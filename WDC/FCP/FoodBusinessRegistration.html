        The Food Business Registration is broken down into two parts.</p>
    <p>
        The first is the ‘Scope of Operations’</p>
    <p>
        The term ‘Scope of Operations’ is used to describe the activities of your food business and also includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;the sector(s) a food business operates under the Food Act 2014, </li>
        <li>&nbsp;what products a food business makes and/or sells, </li>
        <li>&nbsp;how products are sourced and/or supplied, </li>
        <li>&nbsp;how products are processed, if applicable, and </li>
        <li>&nbsp;how products are sold. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you are operating a food business you need to tell us exactly what your business does by completing the &#39;Scope of Operations&quot; part of this online form.</p>
    <p>
        You need to complete the ‘Scope of Operations’ before you register. </p>
