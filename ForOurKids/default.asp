    <td width="630"><div align="left">Volunteering for any amount of time (e.g. an hour once a week or an hour once a month) will make a difference. You might already be volunteerins with sports, clubs or at a local school or Kura - by becoming a For Our Kids accredited volunteer you will be a part of a community-wide network, a partnership, a whanau.<br />
      For Our Kids volunteers receive valuable training and support and we can find you a place to volunteer if you don't already have an accredited For Our Kids organisation to connect with.<br />
      And even if you don't have something like sports, culture, cooking, academic or creative skills to pass on it doesn't matter....sometimes it is just about having someone there to say &quot;give it a go&quot; or &quot;well done, aren't you fantastic!&quot;

To be a Community Partner, groups will go through a simple accreditation program to ensure they are doing the best for our young people and their volunteers.</div></td>

However, there is a lot more to families; grandparents, aunties, uncles, and cousins, and even friends, neighbours, teachers etc. FOR OUR KIDS will recognise the hard work and achievements that our families are doing together and support all the great programs and services that are being offered to our families.</p>
      <p align="left">We are hoping that you will get in behind FOR OUR KIDS, simply by supporting all of our Wanganui young people in what ever way you can</p></td>
