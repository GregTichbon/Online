But she also knows what its like to have your life changed for the better by the time and effort of volunteers, who inspired her to become one herself. Women’s Network manager Miss Donson has been involved with volunteering since she was 14 years old.<br />
“As a youngster my mum got cancer when I was 12, and died when I was 15. During those years it was very challenging for me and that was when I started volunteering and getting into coaching sports.”<br />
Originally&nbsp; from England, Miss Donson said she had only immediate family in Whanganui and got her wider support network from working as a volunteer.<br />
“It’s a little bit of giving back because of my own experiences in my teen years. We as a family experienced a lot of generosity by volunteers. Complete strangers, and I found that really inspiring and I wanted to be like them. They inspired me to make a difference in my own life and of others.”<br />
Miss Donson is involved in numerous organizations and community projects helping youth, including Life to the Max, the Violence Intervention network and the youth services Trust. She was also instrumental in establishing the Whanganui District Council’s Youth Committee.</p></td>

    <td><p>“Being a teen is hard enough without having family and personal issues that are going on at the same time. So its very important that other people step in and take a leadership role.”<br />
As for anyone volunteering, they should just do it. You never know what you might learn and experience along the way, she said.<br />
“I think the amazing thing about being a volunteer is that it always exceeds your expectation, and the rewards that happen from relationship building and the inspiration that happens is so worth it.”</p></td>
