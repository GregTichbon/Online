      Mrs Kumeroa is manager and youth worker at Te Ora Hou Whanganui, where she has worked with Whanganui’s young people for 18 years.<br />
      She became involved in For Our Kids after following its progress from inception.<br />
      Mrs Kumeroa and her husband have over the past 16 years fostered countless young people, and also volunteer for the community action event Stone Soup, which is held every eight weeks, and attracts about 400 families for hangi, games and music.<br />
      “I’m motivated by my faith, and my compassion for children, young people and families. I love it.”<br />
      One of Mrs Kumeroa’s proudest moments was supporting three of the Te Ora Hou youths in writing and recording songs for the album <em>Young…the life of, </em>which was released two years ago.<br />
      “It was the most amazing thing. It was months of organization, writing and recording from young people in Whanganui, and to distribute that across the country and hear it on radio was an amazing success, I cried.”One of her most important roles as a youth worker is to make each youth she works with recognize that they can change their lived and the lives of others.</p></td>

      Sometimes, it simply means parents getting involved with their children’s sports teams.<br />
      “When I think about For Our Kids. I think about a bowling club adopting a school and donating their time to do some remedial reading.”</p></td>
