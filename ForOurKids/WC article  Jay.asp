    <td rowspan="3">For Our Kids ambassador Jay Rerekura is passionate about helping young people in the community.<br />
Mr Rerekura works at Nga Tai o Te Awa as community action team leader on youth and drugs and was a member of the Community Taskforce for Youth Wellbeing, which was created in response to the death of baby Jhia Te Tua in 2007.<br />
He was among the members of the taskforce which started an action group, and&nbsp; For Our Kids was born, he said.<br />
“It’s an initiative for the community to take ownership of what is happening in our community particularly with regard to our young people, and looking at the strengths they have and building on them.”<br />
By the end of the year, they hoped to have more than 200 volunteers working as role models and providing positive support to Whnagnui’s young people.<br />
One of the hopes for For Our Kids was that it would become a brand like the heart foundation tick, that organizations could use to show they were working with young people in the community.<br />
And not just talking the talk, Mr Rerekura is leading by example, and has for most of his life.“I’ve been involved in the community forever, and youth work all of my working life, and before that as well,” he said.Mr Rerekura volunteers with Maori Christian organization Te Ora Hou Whanganui taking time every Monday night to participate in a youth group with people aged 14-18.</td>

Activities included wake boarding at Lake Wiritoa, paddling waka on the river, sports, beach swims, picnics, “Anything that’s positive and that’s happening for them, that gives them a buzz.”<br />
“For me, I have children, and I guess you want to make some positive things happen out there in the community, so that when my kids are out there they are safe. I’m trying to change the world so that my kids have a good place to grow up and things are positive out there for them.”</td>
