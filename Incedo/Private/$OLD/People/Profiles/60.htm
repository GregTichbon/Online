Married to Judy Kumeroa (she didn't like my surname) for 14 years (I think) with three kids; 
Caleb - 9, Grace - 7, and Neo 5. Grace, our daughter, has Down's Syndrome.
<p>I have been involved in Incedo, formally Youth for Christ, both locally and nationally for around 27 years. I started in a band and fronted our local rallies.</p>
<p>In 1983 I started as a leader of Campus Life. 
  Somewhere after that I joined the local board and, at a guess, became the board chairman early to mid 1990s. In the absence of a Director I took on some of the reponsibility to keep the centre going. 
Around 1997 (I've got to suss out these dates) I became the National Administrator.</p>
<p>A lot of my youth and communtiy focus has been with Te Ora Hou, which Jude manages. Recently we have been involved in a community project called Stone Soup which brings our community together every 8 weeks at a local park where we drink tea and coffee, play games, do art and have a hangi for lunch together. We have done 6 of these and have had an average attendance of 350. It's been great to see the community getting to know each other, identify issues, and work out ways  of improving it.</p>
<p>Te Ora Hou operate out of the house next door to our home and across the road from Tawhero School, where the kids attend and I'm on the Board of Trustees. It's an awesome school with great staff and students. We also run an Oscar program at the school. We have been doing quite a few hangi at TOH. For Stone Soup and Pirates.</p>
<p>Caleb and Neo both play rugby for Wanganui Pirates <a href="http://www.pirates.org.nz">www.pirates.org.nz</a> and I'm a coach.</p>
<p>In addition to our own children our family have fostered around 35 children, mostly teenagers over the last 13 years. Four of these spent over two years with us.</p>
