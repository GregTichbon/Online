<p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY BEFORE STARTING </strong></p>
<p>The page is: <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/private/ConnectMe/tidyup.asp">http://www.incedo.org.nz/private/ConnectMe/tidyup.asp</a></p>
<p>Please check by clicking on the NOTE YOUR SELECTION link what things still need to be done, and record your name against the ones you have chosen to do. Do one at a time. Please remember to SUBMIT this page! Then close the browser window to get back to the tidyup page. </p>
<p>Please ensure your mission base is all correct. </p>
<p>To do this just select the LOADED FROM for your mission base. (If there is more than 200 then you will need to use THOSE STARTING WITH as well. Click on the SEARCH button. Make the required changes and click on the SUBMIT button at the very bottom of the page.</p>
<p>You may want to check if your own details are loaded and/or are correct. To do this just type part of your name, your surname is best, but your first name may also work. Organisation names are also searched.</p>
<p>Because we have created a combined database from many of the mission bases databases there are duplicates that we need to get rid of. </p>
<p>To do this select a letter under DUPLICATES STARTING WITH. If there are more than 200 you may have to break it down by making it start with 2 letters eg: BA. Then make the required changes and click on the SUBMIT button at the very bottom of the page.</p>
<p>We are not actually deleting records but simply marking them as being duplicates so that we do not include them in our NZ Newsletter to go out next week. At some stage, when we have more time, I will need to move any data held against the duplicate record to the real record.</p>
<p>There might be two records the same, one from mission base A and one from mission base B. The one from mission base A is flagged as deleted, therefore, it will no longer show on mission base A's list, but the person will still receive this newsletter. </p>
<p>So what do you have to change?</p>
<p>If it's a duplicated address select a STATUS of ON HOLD - DUPLICATED. </p>
<p>If you know the address is wrong, please fix it, or if you don't know the correct address select a STATUS of ON HOLD - INCORRECT ADDRESS</p>
<p>ORGANISATIONS &amp; RECIPIENTS should only be for organisations and recipients there should not be anything in TITLE, FIRSTNAME(S), &amp; SURNAMES at all. Like wise TITLE, FIRSTNAME(S), &amp; SURNAMES should only be for people and there shouldn't be anything in ORGANISATIONS &amp; RECIPIENTS.</p>
<p>You may like to clean up some of the data by replacing AND with &amp;, making everything Upper/Lower case, putting full names rather than just initials where you know them (they may be shown on a duplicated record) Tidying up addresses etc so they are in a nice format, ie: Full Road/Street/Drive/Parade etc.</p>
<p>Use the other status options if they suit, ie: deceased, gone overseas etc </p>
<p>Once you have set a STATUS on a record and clicked on the SUBMIT button that record will no longer be shown in the duplicates or lists for a LOADED FROM </p>
<p>When you have completed your area of duplicates please go back to the  NOTE YOUR SELECTION link, record that you have completed it and then select another one. </p>
<p>You can also edit a full record by clicking on the link on the very left hand side of the lists. There is also an option to create a record. </p>
<p>Thanks for your help, please email me <a href="mailto:g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz">g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz</a> or phone me (027) 2495088 if you need any help.</p>
