  <p>Hey ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>i have a little competion over the summer months. i am in need of <br>
    references where actors use the name of CHRIST as an exclamation or <br>
    what we tern 'blasphemy' if we were getting heated at the pulpit.</p>
  <p>i need references such as -</p>
  <p>PULP FICTION<br>
    1H 22M</p>
  <p>ETERNAL SUNSHINE<br>
    2HR 36M</p>
  <p>I shall take this information kindly sent by you, edit the item, and <br>
    it will become an art piece for the STATIONS OF THE CROSS - art <br>
    exhibition in MARCH IN HAMILTON</p>
  <p>the piece will be for STATION 5# jesus stands before Pilate. the <br>
    screen with the quantum montage of BLASPHEMY will indicate in an <br>
    uncomfortable manner the choice of the audience before Pilate when he <br>
    presented both barabas and jesus.</p>
  <p>I NEED YOUR HELP - I SADLY DO NOT HAVE TIME TO sit on the couch with <br>
    10 dvd's awaiting a script writers disrespect for the son of God.</p>

    IN BY MARCH 1ST!~!!!</p>
