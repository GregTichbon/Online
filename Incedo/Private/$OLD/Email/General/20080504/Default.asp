  <p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p><strong>A message from Scott Rosene </strong></p>
  <p>After much prayer and consideration, I have decided to withdraw my application for membership in Incedo.</p>
  <p>I will finish my current youth ministry responsibilities at the end of this current term, on June 28, after which I will be returning to the USA for a three week visit with family and friends. After that time, I will return to New Zealand, where I intend to continue fellowship with my church family at least until the expiration of my current work visa on March 31, 2009. </p>
  <p>While there is much that I don&rsquo;t know about this next season of life for me, I am confident that God is still in control and that this is the right decision both for me and for the ministries in which I have had the privilege of being involved. </p>
  <p>This decision has been neither easy nor quick. It is the product of much prayer and consultation with wise people who are intimately familiar with my personal faith journey and the needs of our young people. I have appreciated the support and encouragement I have received from Karl on behalf of the MLT.</p>
  <p>It is difficult to summarize in this short letter the last several months of the journey which have led me to this decision. However, it is important to me that you know that my departure is not a statement about you or Incedo. I am incredibly grateful for the privilege of having served as a YFC/Incedo missionary and will forever treasure the memories we have made together. You have taught me a great deal about friendship, joy, mission, authenticity, generosity, faith and servanthood. </p>
  <p>I feel I need some time away from spiritual leadership and youth ministry to recharge spiritually, physically and emotionally and to re-discover the joy of my first love, Jesus. To be honest, as I know some of you have witnessed anyway, I have lost some of the passion and joy I once had&mdash;which I have learned can easily happen when leading and being responsible for the spiritual shepherding of others. Given these factors, continuing as a missionary and youth leader/worker would only be neglecting God&rsquo;s greater priorities, and a lack of faith in God to raise up the right person for the next season of ministry. </p>
  <p>On the recommendation of Youth for Christ in the USA, since I have just completed 10 years of ministry with YFC, I will begin a three month sabbatical at the end of July, during which time I will seek out what the Lord has next.</p>
  <p>The idea of a sabbatical is to provide workers an opportunity for an extended time away from job responsibilities for the purpose of reflection, renewal, and revitalization. It should not be confused with sick leave or vacation, as it embodies the idea of a conscious focus on physical, mental, and spiritual renewal. The word sabbatical comes from the Old Testament Hebrew word &ldquo;Sabbath&rdquo; which literally means &ldquo;rest.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Thinking of the fact that food for God&rsquo;s people came from the ground it was important to rest the soil every seventh year for continued sustenance (Exodus 23). Since the pastor (spiritually) feeds others it is important that the soil from which he produces food must be rich and rested, not exhausted and depleted. [Dr. Daniel Spaite, Time Bomb in the Church]</p>
  <p>My ability to take a sabbatical (and to stay in New Zealand) depends on final approval from my supervisors at the World Outreach office of Youth for Christ in the USA, and is dependent on the continued financial support of God&rsquo;s people, alongside whatever part-time employment I may be able to find.</p>
  <p>My desire is to continue to live in Wanganui, to continue existing friendships, to renew some old friendships which have no doubt been strained by the complicated dynamics of my being a leader in ministry, and to learn how to be a Christ-follower outside of vocational ministry. However, I recognize that the likelihood of being allowed to stay in New Zealand beyond March 2009 is greatly reduced by discontinuing my employment with my church (as youth pastor) and Youth for Christ/Incedo at this time. With God, all things are possible.</p>
  <p>I look forward to continuing to journey with you as long as the Lord allows. Thank you again for your past support and continued friendship.</p>
  <p>Yours in Christ</p>
