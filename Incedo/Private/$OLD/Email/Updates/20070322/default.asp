  <p align="left">Preparations for Surge continue to progress nicely. Here's an update:<br>
          <br>
          After a more careful examination of the work projects presented to us, we believe we currently have 14 Friday projects and 12 Saturday projects, with enough work for 192 people on Friday and 167 people on Saturday. <br>
          <br>
          What this means is that we will either need to turn down some of those who have asked us to help them during our Surge weekend, or we will need to do our best to bring more people than we originally committed to bringing. Thanks for doing your best to increase your originally reported number of anticipated participants.<br>
          <br>
          We have added some variety to the jobs we originally had lined up, which will be especially good for those of your team that are less &quot;manual labor&quot; inclined--note especially the &quot;project&quot; that the Sommerville Centre has given us. To see this project and the others, go to <a href="http://yfc.org.nz/private/surge">www.yfc.org.nz/private/surge</a><br>
          <br>
          Several of our work hosts have commented on various creative ways that they intend to bless, entertain and/or serve those who are working. Although we have not requested or required this, this will certainly add to the &quot;experience&quot; for participants. </p>
  <p>It would also be helpful if you would begin encouraging participants (and/or non-participants) to locate any of the following that you might be able to bring to enable us to complete the work projects assigned to us:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> 36 shovels/spades</li>
    <li> 10-12 wheelbarrows</li>
    <li> 4-6 secateurs/loppers</li>
    <li> 10 rakes</li>
    <li> 2 water blasters</li>
    <li> 60 paint brushes</li>
    <li> 20 paint rollers/trays</li>
    <li> rolls and rolls of sandpaper</li>
    <li> 10-20 sanders </li>
    <li> scaffolding ???</li>
    <li> a qualified builder (to ensure fence building up to code)</li>
