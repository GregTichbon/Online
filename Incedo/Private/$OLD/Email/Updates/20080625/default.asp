  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname|| </p>
  <p>The Gathering is fast approaching and is shaping up to be a fantastic 
    time, with fantastic people. Our time together is short, therefore, we'd 
    love you to commit to arriving for an 8pm coffee and dessert start on the
    Friday night, ending with lunch together on the Sunday afternoon. A
    <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/private/email/updates/20080625/GatheringProgramme.pdf">programme</a> has been put together reflecting Incedos values, although in the
    end it's about the relationships, conversations and issues wrestled with
    together as a community, that will make our time together valuable. The
    programme is a tool, a guide for these things to happen.</p>
  <p>What you'll need to bring:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Donated items for the Garage sale on Saturday afternoon. (If possible, 
        can each Mission base please bring an item of 'higher value' for 
        the 'silent auction').</li>
    <li> Any resources (such as face painting/jewellery making) for
        activities/entertainment during the Garage Sale.</li>
    <li> Personal gear including towels. All bedding is provided.</li>
    <li>$50 fee for the Gathering.</li>
  </ul>  <p>Where you need to go:</p>
  <p>Egmont Eco Leisure Park<br>
    12 Clawton Street<br>
    New Plymouth<br>
