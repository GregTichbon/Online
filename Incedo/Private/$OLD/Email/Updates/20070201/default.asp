  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">    Well this is the first update for 2007.  From all reports Harvest, the North and South Islands Roads trips went really well.  There was a lot of other stuff as well that happened.  All good for 2007.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Readings<br>
    </strong>The reading for February is ... your own. Choose any book of the Bible you wish. For March it will be 1, 2 and 3 John.</p>
  <p><strong>Ethos weekends<br>
  </strong>As you will know the Ethos weekend for the North Island is the 10th and 11th February at Pokaka in National Park. Go to <a href="http://www.pokaka.org.nz">www.pokaka.org.nz</a> for directions etc. We will start with lunch at 12.30 and finish with lunch on Sunday. Please be there on time. The South Island Ethos weekend will be held in Timaru from Lunch on Sat 24th February &ndash; lunch on the 25th. Remember that if you do not attend you will not continue to be member from the next Gathering in June.</p>
  <p>For planning and catering purposes can you email Darryl for the North Island and Paul for the South Island by next Monday (5th) if you are planning to come. We are going to be short of space so no kids&hellip;contact Darryl if this is a problem.</p>
  <p><strong>Surge<br>
  </strong>You will have received the CD from Dave and Glen on this. If you haven&rsquo;t contact Dave on <a href="mailto:d.white@yfc.org.nz">d.white@yfc.org.nz</a> Its going to be good and we should all be planning now to get there and bring some young people.</p>
  <p><strong>Our world<br>
  </strong>It was Karl Barth who said we need to study theology with the Bible open in one hand and the newspaper open in the other. We need to be aware of just what is going on in the world of the young people we are in mission to. Just this morning it was revealed that over 2/3rds of High school teenagers in NZ have a Bebo site. This virtual community is a part of their world&hellip;.what implications does this have for our mission?</p>
  <p>God Bless<br>
