  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">    This update is a bit longer than usual but it has some important information on dates and processes for next year and we want you all to know well in advance.</p>
  <p><strong>Bible Reading</strong></p>
  <p>Tony Campolo (together with people like Jim Wallis and Brian McLaren) is highlighting the need for Christians to get more familiar with the teachings of Jesus. To let our lifestyles be determined by His words. All the more vital then that, as a mission, we stay true to our value of being Jesus centred, and our practice of reading the gospels. Therefore, the readings for next 3 months are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>October - Gospel of John </li>
    <li>November - Isaiah (cos it contains the most prophecies of Jesus life) </li>
    <li>December - Gospel of Luke (who celebrates women more than the other gospels) </li>
  </ul>  <p><strong>Project Serve </strong></p>
  <p>Gus <a href="mailto:g.row@yfc.org.nz">g.row@yfc.org.nz</a> has prepared a proposal (see Project Serve proposal below below) on how we can make PS far more central to our mission. All over the place, Christians and non-Christians are looking for ways to do something of significance. Already there are 4 travel agencies in NZ focused on offering &quot;service&quot; holidays. YFC needs to be pushing the boundaries on this. So the proposal calls us to more sacrificial action. </p>
  <p><strong>Surge</strong> </p>
  <p>This is the replacement for CTC. As previously stated it will be in Whanganui, April 19-22, so ring those dates in indelible ink. Start thinking and talking now, about how you can get members, associates, helpers kids (all ages) to this event. It will set the tone of our mission for years to come. There'll be more details next month but for now - plan to be there! Glen is coordinating this <a href="mailto:g.bennett@yfc.org.nz">g.bennett@yfc.org.nz</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Some items for celebration </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nelson and Marlborough Supporters night <a href="mailto:nelson@yfc.org.nz">nelson@yfc.org.nz</a> <a href="mailto:marlborough@yfc.org.nz">marlborough@yfc.org.nz</a> </li>
    <li>Some great stories of significant moments in kids lives at Rock Solid camps around the country.</li>
    <li>Rock Solid discipleship happening in Timaru <a href="mailto:timaru@yfc.org.nz">timaru@yfc.org.nz</a> </li>
    <li> Change the world discipleship group meeting in Wellington <a href="mailto:r.o&#8217;connor@yfc.org.nz">r.o&rsquo;connor@yfc.org.nz</a> </li>
    <li>Samstock in Otago <a href="mailto:r.grant@yfc.org.nz">r.grant@yfc.org.nz </a></li>
  </ul>  <p><strong>Future membership</strong></p>
  <p>We have agreed that we need a better process for determining who is a member, associate, helper etc. Here is how we will work it for 2007.</p>
  <p><em>Purpose</em>. To have a committed group of members who have the YFC DNA. This will probably mean we have fewer members after the next Gathering (currently 56) but more associates. We need to better define associates and helpers. Gus has prepared diagram with three concentric circles and explains this well. The outer circle has many ways into being a helper, less ways to the next circle to being an associate and only one way into being a member.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="20061004/circles.gif" width="550" height="400"> </p>
  <p><em>Process</em>. We hold a North and South Island weekend for the ethos of membership. This will go from Saturday noon (starting with lunch) and finish after lunch on Sunday. Anyone who wants to be considered a member after the next Gathering must attend one of these.</p>
  <p>The Wanganui Surge weekend (19 &ndash; 22 April) is the work weekend with 2 &ndash; 3 times of reflection, debriefing etc of those who want to be members after the next Gathering (they will have already attended one of the ethos weekends). Again, attendance at this will be necessary to be a member after the next Gathering.</p>
  <p>We will more clearly define associate membership and the practices expected and will have a member coordinate and communicate regularly with these people.</p>
  <p><strong>Dates</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Feb 10 &ndash; 11 Ethos weekend (North Island). Venue to be advised</li>
    <li> Feb 24 &ndash; 25 Ethos weekend (South Island) Venue to be advised</li>
    <li>April 19 &ndash; 22 Wanganui weekend (Surge)</li>
    <li>April 30th All those who want to be members are told yes or no (from Gathering onwards).</li>
    <li>April 30th All associates informed yes or no and regular contact starts.</li>
    <li>June 2 - 3 Gathering (Queens Birthday weekend) this will be for members only. Will probably be in Wellington.</li>
    <li>August Converge South Island focusing on Associates and helpers. Members there to serve them. (actual dates to be confirmed in the next month)</li>
    <li>August Converge North Island focusing on Associates and helpers. Members there to serve them. (actual dates to be confirmed in the next month)</li>
    <li>2008 Same basic time frame except there will be no ethos weekends and gathering can change to best date for members</li>
  </ul>  <p><strong>Finally</strong></p>
  <p>Also below is a letter from Mike Garland, the Board chair. <a href="mailto:changemaker@infogen.net.nz">changemaker@infogen.net.nz</a> This will appear in the national newsletter that Wellington are coordinating but is an excellent summary of where we are at and why. Feel free to share it as necessary.</p>

      <td><p><strong>Project Serve Proposal. A Different Approach. - Gus Row</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Background<br>
        </strong>We&rsquo;ve struggled to get people for the various projects. This may reflect a lack of buy-in to the importance of the concept (I hope that&rsquo;s not the case) or more likely, to the particular projects. </p>
        <p><strong>The Vision&hellip;. The Value</strong><br>
  I&rsquo;m absolutely convinced that the principle behind Project Serve &ndash; of finding ways to serve people and communities &ndash; is vital to our future. I think there are at least 3 ways this needs to be fostered. </p>
        <p><strong>Surge<br>
          </strong>This new flagship event for YFC is crucial. It will help establish a creative servant mentality throughout the mission. It&rsquo;s vital that we all help make it work. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Local Community Projects<br>
        </strong>One of our practices is that we will find local projects outside of YFC to serve. We must get active in making this happen.</p>
        <p>But, in my opinion, these projects must be dangerous or at least put us on the edge. e.g. serving the local Muslim community, or the gay network. We have to put ourselves at risk, otherwise we will just be a youth version of Rotary. </p>
        <p><strong>Project Serve Overseas. </strong><br>
  This is the area I suggest we do differently. Rather than the Nationwide mission organizing projects I propose YFC areas take on a particular location/mission to serve. Some YFC areas could combine. </p>
        <p>For example (and these are only examples not suggestions of actual hook ups) </p>
        <p>Northland/Auckland could take on the work in Myanmar. <br>
  Waikato/Taranaki could take on sewa ashram in India.<br>
  South Akld/Wanganui could take on Vladivostok. <br>
  ..etc. </p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s how it would work. A representative would go and visit and ask how can we serve you? Then they would return and begin involving their whole community in helping. Lets say the orphanage in Myanmar needed school materials.. then YFC would visit schools in Auckland and Northland with photos and info and ask them to donate resources. If Sewa Ashram needed medical supplies, Waikato/Taranaki would ask local medical centres to donate and /or visit. </p>
        <p>The goal would be to involve the non-Christians in our area, in serving the community overseas. This would build relationships all round. </p>
        <p><strong>Projects<br>
        </strong>YFC areas could consider where they&rsquo;d like to get involved and we could decide early next year. </p>
        <p>Places PS already has connection with: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Myanmar </li>
          <li> Vladivostok </li>
          <li> Solomon Islands</li>
          <li> Fiji</li>
          <li> Samoa</li>
          <li> New Delhi </li>
          <li> ...and other centres have connections with other areas, so theres no shortage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: This would not be an exclusive thing. If a person from Waikato wanted to go to Myanmar that&rsquo;s fine. But they&rsquo;d go as part of Northland/Auckland connection. </p>
        <p><strong>Long Term <br>
        </strong>The overall goal is that we&rsquo;ll develop long term servant relationships with a specific mission/village/people rather than just people from all over combining for a few trips every now and again. </p>
        <p><strong>To get there</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li> We need to buy-in to the concept </li>
          <li> We need to commit to a particular location </li>
          <li> We need to find out what would help. </li>
          <li> We need to dream crazy dreams about involving our non-Christian communities in mission &ndash; believe me, people are hungry for it. </li>

      <td><p><strong>A message from Mike Garland, Board Chairman, YFCNZ <br>
  7 Sept. 2006 </strong> </p>
        <p>Involvement with YFC is woven through four decades of my life. Many of you will have similar stories for some, the impact of this ministry much deeper the service to it - much greater.<br>
            <br>
  Right now we are at a place where the changes we have made are greater than at any other time YFC&rsquo;s formidable 60-year history in NZ. In the early stages of the change process we went all over the world to observe other missions and consult with their leaders. We also looked deep within to hear what we sensed God would have us do to stay &ldquo;geared to the times&rdquo; and &ldquo;anchored to The Rock&rdquo;. Some commentators have said that what we are doing is very risky, and it seems that such significant and far-reaching change has seldom been done before. All of them are watching with interest, as many wrestle with the same issues that we face in our westernised, materialistic &ldquo;post&rdquo; post-modern culture. </p>
        <p>In YFCNZ we have faced up to the brutal facts. The methods of the past and the programmes that we have used to reach young people are no longer working the way they used to. Generation X and Y are savvy, energetic, insecure, saturated with options and just as challenging, if not more so, than any generation previously. They are compulsive consumers who see the emptiness and futility of more stuff but cynically go after it anyway. To this generation, everything is relative - and Christianity can look like just another product on offer. What would seem to us as intolerable contradictions in lifestyle barely twinge the collective &ldquo;Gen X-Y&rdquo; conscience. </p>
        <p>In response -we have radically restructured YFCNZ from a youth organization of Christian youth workers, into a Mission Order of committed missionaries. Our goal retake our place as an edgy, prophetic mission - focussed on reaching genuinely unchurched young people. We are not selling out to the mainstream, nor are we becoming &ldquo;Church&rdquo; or cult. We are passionate about being followers of Jesus, building His Kingdom inviting young people onto a journey into a costly and radical faith. We are saying &lsquo;come and look at our lives, participate in our practices and values, and demonstrate with us a radical devotion to God and a concern for people and the world we live in&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>As we move toward a name change to reflect the significant changes we have made we are not succumbing to faddism or abandoning our roots in the worldwide movement of YFC rather wanting to reflect the essence of what we are becoming in this next phase of the mission. We invite you to sit up take a fresh look at what we are doing and ask is this a mission that I want to need to - be part of? </p>
        <p>To finish I am reminded of the words of martyred missionary, Jim Elliot who said, He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep, to gain what he cannot lose.</p>
