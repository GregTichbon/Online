  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>    Hello,</p>
  <p>
    Thank you to all who were able to come to Timaru, it was great to have you here...</p>
  <p> For those of you who were not able to make it, here are some of the highlights:</p>
 <ul><li> Friday night we had a great country welcome at the pub, the locals gave up their spot by the fire for us, and showed us how to use the 'music machine'. Luckily we left before the tween-age music of the 90's came on (thanks Laura).</li>
 <li> Saturday morning we awoke to a crisp -5 frost, with a range of shower temps (from good temp and pressure, to ice cold). Gus is awarded with doing the polar shower.</li>
    <li> The Recreation of the Bayeux Tapestry in mosaic was on show (www.1066.co.nz), as well as the giant jersey and a range of products made in Geraldine.</li>
    <li> After lunch (sponsored by Gran-ma's cheese rolls, U-Bake's bread rolls and some pumpkin soup), Mum gladly introduced Tracey to her namesake truck (a bedford).</li>
    <li> The challenge was on, as we scavenger-hunted Timaru... rumours are that teams cheated, or used alternative means of finding out information.</li>
    <li> Feasting and dancing were apparent, as the sun set on Glenburn youth Lodge... Lenard taught dancing and we heard some bones creaking as Gus, Darryl and Karl swirled and twirled, showing everyone that they could do it too.</li>
    <li> A tasty Indian feast was served up by Bhavit, in various courses so we could have a taste of everything: Bhuja, Mango Lassi, Chicken, Raita, Paneer, Chillies, Daal, Kheer</li>
    <li> Some headed for the rugby, while others sat by the fire and talked.</li>
    <li> Once again the earth froze, giving Mark C a chance to get out the camera to snap up a few amazing shots.</li>
    <li> Brunch was served at 10 (thanks McCain's for the Hash browns), with a big cooked breakfast.</li>
    <li> Hot cafe-made hot drinks, surprised us all when Gus, Darryl and Mal turned up.</li>
    <li> A quick clean up, allowed us to chill out and spend some good time in the prayer room. It was a chance for the creative juices to run wild and spend some peace just thinking, praying and spending time with God.<br>
        </li>
  </ul>  
  <p>All in all, it was an awesome weekend. <br>
          <br>
          A couple of companies sponsored us; a big thanks goes to McCain Foods (Timaru) and U-Bake Bakery. Also, a big thanks goes out to Lenard, Bhavit, Gran-ma and Mum who all helped out in a big way.<br>
          <br>
