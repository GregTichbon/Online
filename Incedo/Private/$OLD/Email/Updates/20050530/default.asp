<p>Hi fellow YFC missionaries</p>

<p>Sorry to have another email so close after the last one but with CTC and YFC Conference only a few days away there are a couple of points we need to communicate.</p>

<ol>
  <li>CTC is a time where we all get very busy.  One of the key goals however is that the young people there all come closer to Jesus.  The altar calls are an important feature of this.  We would like all members to be available to help with the counselling and with Tony Campolo there is usually a big response.  Can we ask that we all move up to the front as soon as the appeal starts and make ourselves available?  Please don’t wait.  It seems every year that we are going back on stage asking for more counsellors.  It’s an honour and privilege to sit and talk to a young person who is wanting help in connecting with Jesus.   Please plan now how the any young people you have brought with you will be looked after in the audience by others while you come forward to help with counselling. </li>
  <li>YFC Conference is based on our well being this year.  We have attending;  two Doctors, a dietician, a financial planner, a ministry couple and are hoping for a lawyer and physiotherapist.  These people will be available to meet with you all one on one for a free consultation.  Our goal is that these services offered will be used when you otherwise wouldn’t access them or were not sure if your issue was serious enough.  Give some thought as to who you will be wanting to meet with…it may be all of them!  The services will be offered on Tuesday afternoon and evening.  The ministry couple (Phil and Bronwyn Tait from the Vineyard in Christchurch) are , in our opinion, excellent in both counselling and in using the Gifts of the Spirit.  They will be available for one on ones in the afternoon and then a group ministry time in the evening. </li>
  <li>Tony Campolo will be speaking on Monday night and on Tuesday morning. </li>
  <li>You can arrive at the Conference in Silverstream (the same place as the Gathering) any time from 4.00pm onwards.  If you need transport contact  Kev in Wellington. </li>
  <li>Great to see the weekly prayer email coming from Taranaki…….thanks heaps Glen and co. </li>
</ol>
<p>See you at CTC</p>
<p></p>
<p>Darryl, Gus and Mal</p>
<p>PS  One more, sorry…..the collection at CTC always seems to take longer than needed.  Can I ask that you all help with collecting the pottles when asked.</p>
