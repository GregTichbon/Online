  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">Sorry that this is quite a big update but there are a number of things to work through.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Readings</strong><br>
    There has been some confusion as to what book we are reading for May. On the prayer update it says Hebrews&hellip;.so Hebrews it is. For June it will be Joshua&hellip;the story of the Hebrews taking the new land, July it will be Acts&hellip;the story of Pentecost and the early missionary endeavours, August will be Colossians&hellip;the pre-eminence of  Jesus in whom the fullness of the deity dwells, September will be Amos&hellip;..the Justice issues, October will be Jeremiah&hellip;.. the young prophet, November will be Revelation&hellip;.who knows what it's about!!!! and December will be Luke&hellip;the story of Jesus leading up to Christmas.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>The Gathering 15th &ndash; 17th June Silverstream</strong><br>
    You will have these dates already booked in. The venue, as in the past, will be Silverstream Park and we will all be in the old Nurses home up the back of camp. This is for members only&hellip;that is members that are going to continue on and have been informed of this by the MLT in the next two weeks or so. The only exception will be those becoming members for the first time and they too will have been informed by the MLT. It is not for those interested. Converge later in the year will do this. Spouses and Children are welcome but there will be no children programme planned. There is no need to register as all members will be there unless your spouse and children are comming then please let us know. Transport requirements to Karl in Wellington <a href="mailto:k.dickson@yfc.org.nz">k.dickson@yfc.org.nz</a></p>
  <p align="left">As part of the Gathering we have the AGM. Please download the <a href="agmagenda.pdf">agenda</a> and <a href="agmreport.pdf">annual report</a> are attached FYI.</p>
  <p align="left">We will also have a legal opinion on how to best use the name Incedo at the Gathering</p>
  <p align="left">The cost will be $55pp. We are also going to have a travel equalisation plan so we all pay about the same for travel no matter where we come from from. Basically everyone attending will be asked to pay an extra $60 each. This will then be redistributed so those from far away will get more back than the $60 and those close won't get any back. A more detailed plan will be sent out later.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Surge 07 and 08</strong><br>
      We are determining where Surge 08 will be held. If you want it in your town contact Karl <a href="mailto:k.dickson@yfc.org.nz">k.dickson@yfc.org.nz</a> by Friday the 25th May. The MLT will make a decision and let everyone know at the Gathering. The dates will be in the middle weekend of the school Holidays i.e. Thursday 24th &ndash;Sunday 27th April 2008. (Most secondary school holidays are from Monday the 21st April to Sunday 4th May. Easter Sunday is March the 23rd unless you are eastern Orthodox and then it&rsquo;s the 27th April!). ANZAC Day is during Surge, Friday 25th, so is a public Holiday. No doubt we will participate in this in some way. We are looking at equalising travel and will let you know more on this in the future.</p>
  <p align="left">There have been a lot of reports come in from Surge which is excellent. There will be time at the Gathering where we will look together at what else can be done and other creative ideas. We do not want to have an evaluation in the traditional sense so any critiques need to be addressed directly to the MLT before the Gathering.</p>
  <p align="left"> <strong>Accounting Issues</strong><br>
    Bryan has almost finished the audit of the 2007 accounts for the whole of NZ; what a job. He has prepared over 20 sets of accounts and had to do some for the last 2 - 3 years. The good news is that he has got us through it. Everyone is now on the YFC system. The Board have asked us to resend everyone the expenditure protocols and Property trust papers that have been sent out in the past to ensure that everyone is up to date. We are moving on these and expect to have everything finalised by September 07. <a href="financing.pdf">Download Financing.pdf</a> Any questions to Darryl <a href="mailto:d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Project Serve - The New Way</strong><br> 
    We have agreed that Incedo will approach our commitment to Project Serve is a new way. Rather than someone organizing projects nationally, each mission base will target a particular area of the world to focus on. <br>
        <br>
        Your 'base' task will be to find ways to serve that area by: <br>
        <br>
        a. Contact (either by a visit or correspondence) to determine local needs that you can assist. <br>
        <br>
        b. Recruiting people in your area to help meet those needs. For example, an orphanage might need school resourses so you would contact schools in your area to help gather materials. The goal will be to involve non-christians here in making a difference there. <br>
        <br>
        c. If the area you have selected would benefit from a team, your task is to organize that. You may then want to advertize to the wider Incedo community to get the people you need for the team. <br>
        <br>
        d. The plan is to develop a long-term contact, ie at least the next 3-5 years, with your target area. <br>
        <br>
        Making it happen<br>
        The one danger we face is that we will all get busy with our regular ministy stuff and put Project Serve in the &quot;too hard&quot; tray. It will only work if we make a concerted effort. <br>
        <br>
        To that end, there will be a small amount of time at the Gathering to discuss this. Please Come with a written outline of your mission base will approach Project Serve over the next 18 months. If you are 'sharing' an area, please contact the other mission bases, to formulate a co-ordinated approach. Contact gus with any questions <a href="mailto:g.row@yfc.org.nz">g.row@yfc.org.nz</a><br>

  <p align="left"><strong>Amnesty Freedom Challenge</strong><br>    
    We have all received information from Gus asking us to bring to the Gathering ideas of what we will do locally for Freedom week. You should also have received an information pack direct from Amnesty...to us as Incedo....with some good information and asking us to fill in a form with our ideas and goals for Freedom week. This form is due in by Monday 14th May. Please get this to them. This is the first Incedo 'contact' with another group....lets do it right! If you have questions contact Gus <a href="mailto:g.row@yfc.org.nz">g.row@yfc.org.nz</a> </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Finally</strong><br>
From this months reading: Hebrews 4:16 &quot;Let us then approach the throne of Grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find Grace to help us in our time of need&quot;.</p>
