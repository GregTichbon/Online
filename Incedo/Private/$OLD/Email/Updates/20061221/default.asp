  <p align="left">    Hi all this is just a quick update about the venues for the Ethos weekends.</p>
  <p align="left">The North Island Ethos weekend is going to be at Taylor Memorial Lodge in Potaka. This is halfway between Ohakune and National Park. (<a href="http://www.potaka.org.nz">www.potaka.org.nz</a>) We will be self-catering (we will organise this) and you will need to bring your own bedding etc. The cost will be about $50.00pp but if we can do it cheaper we will. We will send out a reminder with finalised costs etc in late Jan or early Feb but this is confirmed so book it in. We start with lunch on Saturday the 10th Feb and finish with lunch on Sunday the 11th.</p>
  <p>The South Island venue is still being confirmed but it will be in the Christchurch region and will run from lunch on Saturday the 24th Feb and finish with Lunch on Sunday the 25th. I will let you know final venues etc when we have it.</p>
  <p>I know we have said this several times but I will say it again to avoid any misunderstanding. For someone to be considered for membership (whether they are a current member or otherwise) from the next Gathering onwards they must attend one of the Ethos weekends and Surge. Below is the update that explains the process for you as a reminder.</p>
  <p>Have a great Christmas... it will be good to spend some time together in February and we look forward to the reports of harvest and the two road trips.</p>

  <strong>Future membership</strong>
  <p>We have agreed that we need a better process for determining who is a member, associate, helper etc. Here is how we will work it for 2007.</p>
  <p><em>Purpose</em>. To have a committed group of members who have the YFC DNA. This will probably mean we have fewer members after the next Gathering (currently 56) but more associates. We need to better define associates and helpers. Gus has prepared diagram with three concentric circles and explains this well. The outer circle has many ways into being a helper, less ways to the next circle to being an associate and only one way into being a member.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="20061004/circles.gif" width="550" height="400"> </p>
  <p><em>Process</em>. We hold a North and South Island weekend for the ethos of membership. This will go from Saturday noon (starting with lunch) and finish after lunch on Sunday. Anyone who wants to be considered a member after the next Gathering must attend one of these.</p>
  <p>The Wanganui Surge weekend (19 &ndash; 22 April) is the work weekend with 2 &ndash; 3 times of reflection, debriefing etc of those who want to be members after the next Gathering (they will have already attended one of the ethos weekends). Again, attendance at this will be necessary to be a member after the next Gathering.</p>
  <p>We will more clearly define associate membership and the practices expected and will have a member coordinate and communicate regularly with these people.</p>
