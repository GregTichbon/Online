  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname|| </p>
  <p>Hi All, </p>
  <p>Last week in Auckland there was a serious breach of the Y One protocols and standards. As a result of this, one of the team members was permanently removed from the team on Saturday and sent home. This has left the team in a difficult situation, as another team member would not rejoin the team after Surge. So, due to these circumstances beyond the remaining team members control, the MLT (in discussion with Jason) has therefore decided that Y One 08's tour will finish. This is effective as of Saturday 24 May. This is no reflection on the remaining team members, they have acted with integrity through out what has been a very difficult time for them. </p>
  <p>They have spent a couple of days in Wellington with Paul and myself, where we have talked, prayed, and debriefed them. They are to be commended for the way they have handled this decision; it is a difficult time for them, but they have made some decisions about their individual futures. 3 of the team (Eli, Joel, and Andre) will head up to Taranaki and spend time praying and talking with Jason and Lee as to what the future could look like for them to &quot;re-birth&quot; a new ministry for the remainder of the year. They will present a proposal to the MLT/Board and we will make a decision as to its potential. The remaining member (Monique) has decided to return home, as she feels this the course of action God is wanting her to take- we fully support her choice, and will continue to process this year with her. </p>
  <p>We need to acknowledge Dwight (from last years team) who, at short notice, stepped into the team 4 weeks ago; who not only filled a gap, but provided stability and leadership to the team. He will be spending the next week with the team, and will then inform us of his decision as to the remainder of the year. Dwight has been invaluable over the last few weeks, and we are truly thankful for his willingness to serve the team, and Jason and Lee in this way. </p>
  <p>It is important that we focus on the fact that this years team has made and impact on many young peoples lives, and have served schools and communities faithfully. Even though the team have finished in difficult circumstances, they have spent the last 5 months willing to be used by God. They all have stories of great encounters with young people, and inmates; they will carry those memories with them as they journey forward from this point. </p>
  <p>Please pray for Jason and Lee at this time, as they process with Eli, Andre, and Joel as to any future outworking of the call they feel. Pray for Monique as she settles back into home, and makes decisions about her future. Pray for Becs as she settles back into home, and also makes decisions about her future. </p>
  <p>If you have any questions please direct them to either Paul or myself. </p>
  <p>Peace <br>
  </p>
