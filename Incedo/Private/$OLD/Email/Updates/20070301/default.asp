  Judith Crump's email address was incorrect in the last update. Her email address should have read: <a href="mailto:thecrumps@clear.net.nz">thecrumps@clear.net.nz</a>.</p>
  <p align="left">The full text is: <br>
    We have agreed that all YFC computers will have the program; x3Watch installed by the end of February. Go to <a href="http://www.x3watch.com">www.x3watch.com</a> and follow the instructions. The accountability people are Sue Gardiner (<a href="mailto:s.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">s.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a>), Marg Row (<a href="mailto:m.row@hotmail.com">m.row@hotmail.com</a>), Judith Crump (<a href="mailto:thecrumps@clear.net.nz">thecrumps@clear.net.nz</a>). You can choose one. Any questions to Mal (<a href="mailto:m.green@yfc.org.nz">m.green@yfc.org.nz</a>)</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Incedo Pronunciation</strong> <br>
    It has been pointed out that in Latin the &quot;c&quot; is pronounced &quot;k&quot; thereby making Incedo sound &quot;In kay doe&quot;. However, we will pronounce it &quot;<strong><font color="#FF0000">In Seed oh</font></strong>&quot;. If anyone says it should be &lsquo;In kay doe&rsquo; tell them we are basing it on the Latin not using the original. </p>

        Promotion <img src="surge.gif" width="211" height="144" align="right"><br>
      </strong>A &quot;Promotion Strategy&quot; for your potential Surge participants ...</p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">1. Plan one of your club nights around serving others</font> (or spend a Saturday working at your local mission, etc.). </p>
        <p><em>Give your young people an opportunity to experience the joy of serving others locally</em>. In Wanganui, we adopted a street, went door to door offering to mow peoples' lawns, wash windows, pull weeds, etc. and gave away items we'd collected to people who wanted/needed them (e.g. a microwave, flowers, plants, etc.) Very little planning, very thankful neighbours, very appreciated young people... very much anticipation about the potential of a much larger workforce.</p>
        <p>When we were finished, the kids were asking &quot;When's the next one of these?&quot; They thought it was a blast and could hardly wait to do it again.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000">2. Show the Group Workcamps Video. </font></p>
        <p>You can download it at <a href="http://www.groupworkcamps.com/promotional-videos">www.groupworkcamps.com/promotional-videos</a> (Click on the &quot;Workcamps Promo&quot;) or contact Rory Grant (<a href="mailto:r.grant@yfc.org.nz">r.grant@yfc.org.nz</a>), who is editing a higher resolution DVD with the same video on it. It inspires people with the potential for what an event like Surge can accomplish not only in the lives of those we serve, but in ourselves also. </p>
        <p>Once you've seen it yourself, you'll have a better idea of how you might use this.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000">3. Show the Surge Promo Video.</font></p>
        <p>It's short, fun, and gives people a brief introduction to Wanganui and a few projects we've lined up here.</p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000">4. Pray. </font></p>
        <p>This event isn't about numbers. We want people to come because of a desire to serve Jesus style, not because of a flashy video or a slick brochure. </p>
