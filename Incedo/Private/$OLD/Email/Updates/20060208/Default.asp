Dear ||usefirstname||
<p> Below are links to two files.</p>
<p>1. <a href="20060208/MissionReview06.pdf">MissionReview06.pdf</a> is the review tool that we talked about in our last update to members that you received a few days ago. Please get on to this A.S.A.P. The whole process needs to be completed by 10 March. We think you will find it a useful exercise.</p>
<p>Print off the review (3 pages) and it should take no more than 15 minutes to fill out - Mal has done it for himself and it took 10 minutes. The processing of it with a small group of members may take up to an hour. The completion of this is necessary for all members who wish to continue in membership of the YFC NZ Mission Community. Please send your completed form once you have met with some other members to review to us electronically to <a href="mailto:m.green@yfc.org.nz">m.green@yfc.org.nz</a> or by post to P O Box 34552, Birkenhead, Auckland by March 10.</p>
<p>2. <a href="20060208/Associates.pdf">Associates.pdf</a> is an explanation of a new level of membership that SLC talked about and decided to proceed with.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your responses and please let us know any questions or ways in which we can assist you with this.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
