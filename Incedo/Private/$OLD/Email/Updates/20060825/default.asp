  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">    This is special update to ensure that all members know our abuse protocols.  </p>
  <p>It is a sad reality that young people in New Zealand are abused and often in church or youth group situations. We in YFC want to provide a totally safe environment so it does not happen in our mission. We also hold to the fact that boundaries need to be maintained between YFC workers (be they volunteers or part time or full time) and young people. This includes the fact that YFC workers are not to engage in any romantic or sexual activity with service recipients. The Board and MLT, at our meeting on Sunday, reaffirmed our commitment to this safety protocol and to ensure we are all aware of it decided to send out this special update. </p>
  <p>At the bottom of this update is a copy of our procedure that must be used should abuse or a boundary be crossed. (You may also <a href="20060825/abuse.pdf">download a pdf version</a>.) The key issue is that you must always pass on the information within 48 hours (if not sooner) regardless as to whether you think or know it is true or false. We will have training on this in the future so we are all safe as God would have us be. </p>
  <p>Please contact us if you have any questions. </p>
  <p>God Bless </p>
