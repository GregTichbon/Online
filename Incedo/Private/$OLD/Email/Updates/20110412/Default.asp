  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">Over the past 3 years, Incedo has been in discussion with Youth for Christ International over some concerns they raised about our change from Youth for Christ NZ to Incedo Inc. In answer to their questions, we tried to show that the change was a positive one that expressed our attempt to be more authentic, transparent, committed, intentional, relevant and focused in taking the gospel to young people in our communities. We were not wanting deliberately to separate ourselves from YFCI but hoped that we could be seen as a community of people within YFCI exploring a different way of practising what YFCI seems to think is its purpose &ndash; youth evangelism, discipleship, leadership development.</p>
  <p align="left">In the end, it seems that the main problem YFCI has with Incedo is that we do not fit their structural requirements and we do not meet their performance outcomes. Some of the things they asked were:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  A national board of 9 members (although they would accept 7).</li>
    <li> The use of the YFCI logo on our website (which we did).</li>
    <li> A declaration of belief in the YFCI statement of faith (a statement of faith that is now not accepted by probably the majority of Christendom).</li>
    <li> Compliance with the &ldquo;Unifying Essentials&rdquo; (although exactly what these are has been hard to clarify).</li>
  </ol>  <p align="left">In March 2010, Incedo was relegated to &ldquo;Associate Membership&rdquo; of YFCI and we were under the impression that there would be considerable dialogue about how what Incedo might still fit with YFCI.</p>
  <p align="left">However, after minimal correspondence over the past year, we were somewhat surprised last month to receive an e-mail from Neil Boyle, YFCI Asia Pacific area director, informing us that the YFCI world leadership team had de-chartered Incedo Inc as a member of YFCI.</p>
  <p align="left">No clear explanation was given as to why and, now that the decision has been made, an offer was made for someone from YFCI to come and talk to us about it. We have been offered the option of applying to become a &ldquo;Candidate country&rdquo; and start the journey to being a chartered member of YFCI if we want.</p>
  <p align="left">At present, the Incedo board and MLT are considering where to go from here but, to be honest, being part of YFCI in the near future does not seem likely based on the events of the past few years.</p>
  <p align="left">Nevertheless, we will continue to retain strong links to our friends in YFC &ndash; especially in the Pacific and Asia &ndash; and we will be contacting these people this week to let them know that we want to keep these relationships alive.</p>
  <p align="left">Please contact Blair or Glen with any comments or questions on this matter.<br>
