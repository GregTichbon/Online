  <p>We have had a request from one of our brothers in Sri Lanka, who is 
          looking for a pen friend. It is slightly unusual, but it is a timely reminder that we are not alone in our journey; there are others in the world 
          that have the same heartbeat as us. Our brothers and sisters in Sri Lanka 
          have it tough, and it would be good if someone responded to his request. His 
          details are as follows:<BR>
          <BR>
          Nimal is 29 years old.&nbsp; Interests: Music and TV programs and penpals. 
          He works for Y-gro the social action arm of SLYFC. He lives in the war torn 
          city of Mannar. He was married to Niruja sometime late last year or early 
          this year. His e-mail address is <A 
href="mailto:ygromann@sltnet.lk">ygromann@sltnet.lk</A>&nbsp; Ajith Fernando who is the National Director of SLYFC, has 
          endorsed Nimal's request for a penpal.</p>
  <hr>        <BR>
        Please <a href="WayneKirkland.pdf">download</a> a paper that Wayne Kirkland wrote (at the request of the 
          board), based on our journey thus far. He spent time talking with various 
          ones of us about how we feel it has gone, our hopes, struggles, the 
          challenges we see ahead, and our "successes".
          
        <p>One topic that has been raised 
          is that of "mentoring" or "pastoral care". So we are distributing Wayne's paper 
          for two reasons. Firstly, it is interesting reading. Secondly, we are keen 
          to have people feedback to us their thoughts on how we can care for one 
          another better, support one another, and how we make our community&nbsp;"function". There is no one to do it for us; it is up to us to make it 
    happen. Please take the time to feedback constructively, passionately, and any 
    other "ely" words that come to mind.

  <p>There will be a newsletter coming out early October. It has just gone to print. Greg has almost combined the databases that have been supplied to him from the mission bases and is working to make it so that you can maintain the details directly online. This is now the NZ supporters database, please do not use or maintain any others! Greg will do his best to make sure you can do whatever you need to with the new online single database. If you have any comments or questions please contact Greg (027) 2495088 or <a href="mailto:g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz">g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz</a>.</p>
