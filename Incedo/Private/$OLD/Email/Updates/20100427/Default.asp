  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>Hello friends!</p>
  <p>There are a couple of opportunities for us as a community to get together and hear some potentially provocative thoughts from some people of our day. </p>
  <p> We'd like to recommend them to you and ask that if you're keen to take part to let Melody know so we can connect those who will be attending to help sort out accommodation and transport as needed.</p>
  <hr>  <p>Mike King, president of YouthFRONT Ministries in Kansas City is coming to NZ and will do three seminars in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>  Auckland: 9.30am-4.00pm on Thursday 3 June<br>
        Edge City Church, 44 George St, Kingsland, Auckland. </li>
    <li> Wellington: 9.30am-4.00pm on Friday 11 June<br>
        Petone Baptist, 38 Buick St, Petone, Wellington. </li>
    <li> Christchurch: 9.30am-4.00pm on Monday 14 June <br>
        Canterbury Youth Services, 472 Cranford Street, Papanui, Christchurch </li>
  </ul>  
  <p>The cost for each seminar is $35.00 waged and $25.00 for students. Both Mike and YouthFront have an approach to youth ministry that affirm that transformation in youth people comes as they encounter Christ and grow in relationship with him. It is not a programme centred approach or even a purpose centred one. It is a &quot;presence centred&quot; way of doing youth ministry. It works to bring youth into a growing relationship with Jesus Christ by creating environments where spiritual transformation occurs. It is not a &quot;new&quot; approach to discipleship but rather a return to many historical practices and a chance to jump off the programme centred roundabout. Mike has many practical things today but he is also very inspirational - even prophetic, in what he says. </p>

  <p>      Rob Bell from Mars Hill in Grand Rapids, Michigan will be doing both a performance and seminar in Auckland and Christchurch.</p>
  <p> Poets Prophets Preachers is a one-day teaching seminar exploring what it looks like to compellingly communicate the provocative, dangerous, fascinating, convicting, subversive, beautiful message of the resurrected Jesus.</p>
  <p>Whether you're a teacher, preacher, leader, artist, activist, or organizer, this seminar is for anyone fascinated, frustrated, intoxicated, or exhilirated by the creative process and how it shapes, relates, and informs the life of faith. The Drops Like Stars tour is a two hour exploration of the endlessly complex relationship between suffering and creativity.</p>
