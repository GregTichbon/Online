  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">Just a quick update re the Gathering this weekend.<br>
    <br>
    1. There is no programme as such on Friday night but the cafe will be open and it'll be a good chance to lax out. Arrive anytime but have a feed before you get there although there will be soup and rolls available. We finish after lunch on Sunday. <br>
    <br>
    2. The AGM is on Sunday...you have already received the reports and agenda etc with the last update. The only correction is that Dave Tims name was not on the list of board members...it should have been.<br>
    <br>
    3. The equalising travel system is simple.....everyone pays $60.00 on top of the Gathering fee which will be redistributed based on how far you have come...some will get a lot more back and some will get none. If the lateness of this has caught you by surprise and cannot do it....no problem.<br>
    <br>
    4. Don't forget the gift table. Bring something to give away that you would want/need.<br>
    <br>
    We look forward to seeing you there.</p>
