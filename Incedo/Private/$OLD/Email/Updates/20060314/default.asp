<p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
<p>Its only just over 2 weeks before we meet on the 31st March as a mission community for our Gathering. Thanks to those who have completed their review forms and if you have not but are planning to, let us know please. Completion and return of the review form is necessary before you can attend The Gathering. And it&rsquo;s important we know who is going to be there for catering and planning purposes.</p>
<p>The Gathering has as part of it the Annual General Meeting. The notice is included with this update and you will receive in the post this week more information along with some reading material for the Gathering. This is to help focus our thinking on the missional issues we face as a community and as missionaries that are trying to reach the young people of Aotearoa.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep each other in prayer and look forward to spending time together shortly.</p>
<p>God Bless</p>
<p></p>
<p>Darryl, Gus and Mal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

We will also be asking for a ratification of the MLT.</p>
<p>Constitutionally the National Board appoints itself and seeks ratification from the members. The Mission Team Leader is automatically a member of the Board with full rights.

<p>Constitutionally the National Board appoints the Mission Leadership Team (MLT). While this does not need the ratification of the Annual Meeting we are seeking it this time as a sign of confidence so we can all move ahead positively.

<p>Any comments, questions on any of the above should be put to a member of the MLT or Board before the meeting.</p>
<p>Agenda and annual report from the MLT attached along with notes from the constitution.</p>
