  <p align="left">    Just a quick update for September.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Project Serve - URGENT<br>
    </strong>There is planned a team to be at the Hukanui Marae in Hamilton from the 30th October to the 5th November. (you could come for some of the time. The cost will be $250pp (negotiable for families). We do not enough to make this team viable at this stage. If you can attend or have people who could please contact Gus straight away. We particularly need builders and sparkies etc. Contact Gus with questions etc on <a href="mailto:g.row@yfc.org.nz">g.row@yfc.org.nz</a> </p>

  <p align="left"><strong>Bible Reading.</strong><br>
      Bible reading for this month is James. He sums up pure and faultless religion in chapter 1:27&hellip;.good measurement for all of us including YFCNZ.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Prayer Update</strong><br>
      Glen sends this out each week with a reminder. Let&rsquo;s make the most of it by for praying for our comrades in mission, getting others to pray for us. It is also a good way of keeping updated in what&rsquo;s happening around NZ. We are constantly reminded that we have much to thank God for!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>YFC Website</strong><br>
      Gareth Bedford has designed a new website for us. Greg is in the process of making it live. I have seen it and it looks great. He will be in touch shortly but it will only stay fresh if we can keep the information up-to-date. He will let you know when it is posted. If you have any ideas for development contact greg at  <a href="mailto:g.tichbon@yfc.org.nz">g.tichbon@yfc.org.nz</a> <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Supporters Nights</strong><br>
      To date we have only heard from Marlborough and Nelson. Please get back to Darryl <a href="mailto:d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a> this week with a date for this event. We must get the message out to our supporters about who we are now and where we are going.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Members forum</strong> - <a href="http://www.membersforum.org.nz">www.membersforum.org.nz </a><br>
      Dave Tims has updated a paper he wrote a couple of years ago on conversion. This is now posted for you to look at and discuss. This subject is obviously vital to us and this will get some thinking going. If you have something you think we could post to have some discussion then get it to Darryl<a href="mailto:d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a> and we will see if it can happen. Any hassles signing in etc contact Tim <a href="mailto:t.weil@yfc.org.nz">t.weil@yfc.org.nz</a> or Rory <a href="mailto:r.grant@yfc.org.nz">r.grant@yfc.org.nz</a> <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Yone incident</strong><br>
      There was an incident with Yone in Cromwell last week. Karl punched a 14 year old boy in a school. The police arrested him and he was given diversion. He is now off the team. He apologised to the school and the boy and his family. This is obviously a sad and tragic incident that we take very seriously. Karl has been very remorseful and spent a few days with Jason before returning home. Matt Hegan from Otago stepped up to the plate and did a fantastic job with the team and the team themselves are doing ok. They are in Christchurch this week. Please pray for Karl, the boy, the school and the team. Also thank the Lord for the way he is making good out of what the Devil meant for harm<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Membership in 2006<br>
      </strong>A group of members (Rory Grant, Dave Tims, John Brooks, Karl Dickson, Rachael O'Connor, Blair MacKenzie and Glen Bennet) met with the MLT for an overnighter before the last Board meeting in August. Part of the discussion was on how we consolidate the membership and strengthen the associate membership. It was a good time and a clear consensus was reached that was agreed to by the Board. We really need to define what it means to be a member, associate or helper. All are equal in worth but have different expectations. It was agreed that in the future there needs to be a definite procedure for membership probably based on an apprenticeship model. For current members (56) we are planning a process based on the ethos, core values etc that will determine whether people stay as a member or become an associate or helper. It is expected we will have fewer members but they will have the DNA that we can then grow from and we will have more associates and helpers. We will let you know what this process is. But remember it is aimed at making sure we are all serving Jesus in the best place for us and YFC in this order.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>MLT Change</strong><br>
          Mal has resigned from the MLT as he indicated at the Gathering. He is still a member and based in Auckland with a number of missional projects on the boil. We will hear more on this at a later stage. I think it is fair to say we would not have been able to get to where we are without Mal's input and leadership&hellip;thanks Mal. It is also exciting to state that Karl Dickson has agreed to join the MLT and was appointed by the Board on August the 20th&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;great news.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Changes</strong><br>
          Scotty is back from Sabbatical, Dave Treeby is no longer on staff but is still a member, Sarah is married and Gus is no longer on the Waikato leadership Team but remains a member. The thing to celebrate here is that we have three long serving YFCers, Dave, Mal and Gus, all who are moving out of the leadership roles they were in but are still in the mission helping create new ways to stay true to our purpose&hellip;.this is a massive change from the way most groups go and it means we are changing, as we said we would, while not losing the wisdom and skills of members but finding different ways for people to be involved&hellip;..again we have much to thank the Lord for.<br>
          <br>
          So lets keep tracking together and as James says &ldquo;be wise&rdquo; (chapter 3:13)<br>
