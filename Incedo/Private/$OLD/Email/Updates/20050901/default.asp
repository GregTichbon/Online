Dear ||usefirstname||
<p>Just a quick update from the MLT.</p>
<p>The Gospel for September is Mark (only 16 chapters so if you want you can read it twice by reading a chapter a day!) You can download audio chapters from the Gospels at <a href="http://www.yfc.org.nz/private/bible/">www.yfc.org.nz/private/bible</a></p>
<p>One of our values is Mission through Service with the practice that we assist with a non YFC community project. Two examples are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. From Northland: Barnados Children's day for about 3000 kids and families on October 30th 2005. The YFC members run different activities such as; Volley Ball ongoing comp, top of the world earth ball, horizontal bungee, egg challenge etc. They run games all day for Mums and Dads, Boys and girls The RS young people and leaders help run activities</p>
  <p>2. From Wanganui: YFC assist local churches to put on an event called Youth of the Nation. It's a 3 day event with evening sessions including speakers and bands and daytime workshop options for young people to learn about various spiritual growth topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another practice under Mission through Service is that all members will go a Project Serve Trip every three years. We have trip going to Myanmar in December from about the 11th &ndash; 21st so contact Darryl <a href="mailto:d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a> if you are interested in more details. Julie Heaton will be leading the team.</p>
<p>Another of our values is Jesus Centered with the practice that we are to pray for each team member each week. The Taranaki crew have added to this with the weekly prayer update <a href="http://www.yfc.org.nz/private/prayer">www.yfc.org.nz/private/prayer</a> so we can pray for each other around NZ. I think it&rsquo;s great and also a great source of what is going on. Make sure you make use of it by giving prayer requests and things to thank God for as well as using it to pray for others in this mission. </p>
<p>Another practice under the value of Jesus Centered is that we are to ask after each event how we represented Jesus. Let&rsquo;s get some feedback as to how this is working out. I am sure that we will find that sometimes we haven&rsquo;t represented Him as we hoped. Let&rsquo;s hear about these so we can all learn together.</p>
<p>We have just finished a North Island and South Island consult with John Smulo from Australia. He works with Satanists and not only blew away a lot of wrong notions about Satanists abut also challenged us with some vital mission principles that we need to grapple with if we are going to reach this nation&hellip;.more on this later.</p>
<p>Dates for 2006. We have the following dates confirmed so get them in your diaries now.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Gathering. 10th &ndash; 12th February at Silverstream Park (Wellington)</li>
    <li>North Island Converge. 21st &ndash; 23rd April 2006 at Taupo.</li>
    <li>South Island Converge. Dates to be confirmed</li>
  <li>CTC. 3rd &ndash; 5th June Wellington (Note that Dave Treeby and Tracy are currently going through the process of getting feedback on how we should do CTC in the new YFC. They will be meeting in a number of places but contact them direct if you have any comments <a href="mailto:d.treeby@yfc.org.nz">d.treeby@yfc.org.nz</a> <a href="mailto:t.bedford@yfc.org.nz">t.bedford@yfc.org.nz</a> )</li>
  <li>YFC Conference. 5th &ndash; 7th June.</li>
</ul>
  And finally we are planning to run the Internship next year. We will be in contact later with details but begin to think who could attend. It will be for anyone who is prepared to become a member for the year and as well as being trained serve the wider mission. It should be good for those who are looking at a Gap year as well as those who are active already. Contact Darryl for details<a href="mailto:d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz"> d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a>
  <p>Thanks everyone and keep us informed with any developments&hellip;..including ones that fail&hellip;.YFC is place where we celebrate failures as we must have them to grow and develop in new ways.</p>
<p>God Bless</p>
