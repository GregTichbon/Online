  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Welcome to the last update of the Year and the Decade.</strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Glen&rsquo;s Leadership New Zealand experience</strong></p>
  <p align="left"> I have just completed being part of the Leadership New Zealand programme for 2010. What an incredible and insightful programme. Thirty participants, from around the country, from all sectors: Business, Government, Council, and Community on a leadership journey. We began in February and graduated at the end of November. Each month we were together for two to three day retreats where we delved into issues like: a civil society, our people, 21st century governance, New Zealand on the world stage, leadership and innovation, the media &hellip;.. I've come away from this rather flash experience with a new confidence around the skills and abilities I have to offer, plus realising that to be someone of influence doesn't mean you need to be rich and powerful. Meeting people like Sir Paul Reeves, Sir Tipene O'Regan, Pat Snedden and Debbie and Ngahau Davis was humbling and exciting. From here I'm challenged to be more at ease with my skills base, having a better perspective and vision for our future. <a href="http://www.leadershipnz.co.nz">www.leadershipnz.co.nz</a></p>

          Thanks so much to Incedo for your generous support of me while I've been on the programme. 
        </p>
  <p align="left">Please feel free to contact me if you would like to find out more about my experience.            </p>

  <p><strong>Daily Prayer texts and weekly email updates</strong></p>
  <p> 
      Two effective ways to have regular contact with one another are our prayer texts and email updates. They also represent two vital needs of a nation-wide mission: prayer, and staying in touch. Special thanks to our prayer text/email update co-ordinators, Sue during October, Melody during November and also Laura, this month.

  <p><strong>New Initiative Fund</strong>  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Sky Is Just The Start &ndash; This is the dream of a young Lehi Duncan who together with the help of Rob Willis want to help and inspire young people to overcome many issues they face day to day so that they might inspire others and reverse the accelerating range of youth problems. This is based out of Hamilton. <a href="http://www.THESKYISJUSTTHESTART.com">www.THESKYISJUSTTHESTART.com</a></li>
    <li>Bay of Plenty BMX Tour &ndash; We have given funding to the BMX club to support their planned trip to Vladivostok next year. They will be taking a team over, plus extra bikes to gift to the youth there. </li>

  <p><strong>... Ah yes, Christmas</strong> is upon us, and we're about to say farewell to another decade, and a very significant one for so many reasons and for so many people. Incedo's decade has been huge, we didn't exist a decade ago and for those of you who welcomed the new millennium in with YFC, could you have imagined where we'd be today? There&rsquo;s sure to be mixed feelings and great memories that you hold onto.</p>
  <p>As Christmas approaches and the New Year arrives, let&rsquo;s make it our desire to respectfully remember the past, and then move our gaze to the future, the telling of a new story, a clean slate of a new mission in a new decade. Incedo is on the move, we are evolving, shaping and forging new paths of mission and ways of bringing young people on our faith adventure. What will Incedo's story be at the end of the 2010's?</p>
  <p>May you, your whanau and friends know the Hope, Peace, Joy and Love that Christ incarnate brings to our messy, yet wonderful world. 
  </p>
  <p>Christ-mas Blessings</p>
