  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname|| </p>
  <p>Many of you familiar with teenage guys in particular, will be aware of the popularity of what's known as Manga - graphic novels or comics. Heavily Japanese influenced in style. Lots of kids read them.<br>
    <br>
    I located a copy of the Manga Bible. Yep, a Manga artist has done the Bible. Obviously it's not the entire story but it is a great 'comic' telling of Genesis - Revelation, and each episode refers the reader to the original text if they want to know more.<br>
    <br>
    If you want to check it out go to <a href="http://www.themangabible.com">www.themangabible.com</a>. I can source some for $30.<br>
    <br>
    Ideal for a 15 year old skateboarder who mumbles, doesn't really get into the religion thing, and likes torturing frogs. Just kidding, but the graphics style is an acquired taste. Be assured that Darryl and I would have loved it when we were 15. Actually we still will!<br>
    <br>
    Let me know if you're interested.<br>

        P.S. Girls will like it too</p>
