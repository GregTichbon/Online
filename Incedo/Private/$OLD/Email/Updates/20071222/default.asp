  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname|| </p>
  <p>Festive greetings everyone!</p>
  <p>Wishing you a very happy Christmas from us. A few things of 
    note in this update:  </p>
  <p>1. A reminder of dates for Surge in Blenheim: Thursday 24th 
    - Sunday 27th April 2008. This is something that we hope
    will be a reminder that Christ's presence is alive and well.</p>
  <p> Thank you to Toni and John for the amazing work they are 
      doing in putting it all together this time round. Please 
      pray for them and if you can offer to help out with any of 
      the organising before Surge make sure you let them know.</p>
  <p>2. A reminder of dates for the Gathering: Friday July 
    4-Sunday July 6th 2008. This is the first weekend of the 
    July school holidays. The Gathering will be in New Plymouth 
    next year. Much thanks to Glen for offering to host us. </p>
  <p>3. How cool are we now that we are officially Incedo? The 
      paperwork from theCompanies Office has all gone through 
      and we are now legally known as Incedo. You can get a copy of the certificate from <a href="IncedoCertificateofIncorporation.pdf">here</a>. Coming up sometime 
      soon Darryl is going to send through an email giving 
      us the how-to instructions on changing bank account details<br>
      and the such like. </p>
  <p>4. We (MLT) are meeting in January to discuss membership 
    and our direction for the next 2 years. If you have any 
    thoughts to put in the mix, ideas or suggestions to consider 
    please flick us an email on <a href="mailto:mlt@incedo.org.nz">mlt@incedo.org.nz</a> or call any 
    one of us.</p>
  <p>5. On your behalf, Incedo has given a Christmas donation to 
    Womens' Refuge as they do wonderful work and are very busy at
    this time of year. Please keep them and those they care for 
    in your thoughts over this time.</p>
  <p>6. And, lastly, we wish you all a wonderful Christmas and 
    all the very best for our various projects, roadtrips, camps 
    and general community living. Til we meet again! </p>
  <p>Take care and God bless</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Julie, Paul, Karl<br>
