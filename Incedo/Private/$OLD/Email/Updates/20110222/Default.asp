  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">The MLT was privileged to spend a few days with fellow Incedo members in Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga via Cambridge at the end of January. We also spend time with families, volunteers and were able to have conversations with members that went a little deeper. We are a mission that is People Focused. If our focus is that people are more important than programmes we need to spend time not just with the people around us that we&rsquo;re serving but quality time with other Incedo members. We can so easily get caught up on our computers, or spending time worrying about funding, finance and other things. Our hope is that we can all continue to build our relationships with each other, relationships that are real, honest and life giving.</p>
  <p align="left">While in Auckland, Mal talked to us about his effort to daily live out Incedo's values. &ldquo;When I get up in the morning I ask myself, how can I be Jesus focused today? How can I be people focused today? How can I be generous today &hellip;&rdquo; </p>
  <p align="left">Why not try the 7 day M.G morning values reflection challenge? Thanks Mal for this reminder to us, in the midst of our busy lives.</p>
  <p><strong>Board &amp; MLT Retreat</strong><br>
    The Board and MLT are having a retreat over the weekend of the 4th to 6th March. Please pray for this time as we dream, plan and look at challenges we're facing. Some of what we'll be talking about is: Incedo's finances, and how we can be wise with what we have, our relationship with YFC International, plus reflections on where we've come from - where we're at - and where we're going.</p>
  <p><strong>2011 Reminders</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Truth Safe</strong> &ndash; 18/19 March: Auckland<br>
          If you haven't already let Darryl know you would like to attend, make sure that you let him know now.</li>
    <li><strong>The Gathering</strong> &ndash; 15-19 July: Palmerston North<br>
        Venue: Highland Home Christian Camp. Refer to: <a href="http://www.highlandhome.co.nz">www.highlandhome.co.nz</a> </li>
    <li><strong>Surge</strong> &ndash; 7-10 October: Hamilton</li>
  </ul>  <p><strong>Melody's Departure</strong><br>
    We're saddened that Melody is having to move on from her time in New Zealand. She's brought real energy and life to our Incedo community and we thank her for being a part of Incedo's development and growth. Melody is back in the country during April and we plan to have a farewell shindig for her while she's here. Stay tuned for more details.</p>
  <p><strong>Monthly Members Events &amp; Happenings Calendar</strong><br>
    We would like to develop a member&rsquo;s calendar of events and happenings e.g Laura&rsquo;s teaching placements, Whanganui&rsquo;s Stone Soup&rsquo;s, Darryl&rsquo;s speaking at the NZ Judges Forum, Waikato&rsquo;s Pulse event, Dennis&rsquo; 21st birthday.</p>
  <p>Being<em> People Focused</em> we'd like to know what's happening in your world. Keeping in mind it's not just the big events and mission happening&rsquo;s, we'd also like to know significant things coming up. For example, Glen is trying to get a mobile coffee business going, so he could post on the calendar when it&rsquo;s his first day of operating.</p>
  <p>Please let us know your suggestions of how/what/when to help make this happen.</p>
  <p>Enjoying the Faith Adventure Journey with you,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Glen, Tracy and Sarah<br>
