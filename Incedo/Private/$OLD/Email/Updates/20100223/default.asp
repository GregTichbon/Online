  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">I only meant to be at school today for 15 minutes. I only popped into student services before my meeting to grab a glass of water. That&rsquo;s all, nothing else. It was not my intention to suddenly find myself in the midst of 20 students, while 2 young blokes tried to punch each other. Do you think I enjoyed having to grab one and take him into a dean&rsquo;s office while teachers tried to sort the mess out? Not really. All I wanted was a glass of water and a chance to relax before my meeting. But what intended to do, and what I ended up doing were poles apart.</p>
  <p align="left"> It s funny how what we intend to do, and what we end up doing are often at different ends of the spectrum. Take the Church for example, they intended to love everyone (as Christ commanded), they intended to provide places of sanctuary, they intended to show Christ&rsquo;s compassion to all. Yet what they ended up doing to the GBLTI (Gay, Bi, Lesbian, Transgender, and Intersex) community was almost the exact opposite. Where there should have been love, there was hatred and fear; where there was supposed to be sanctuary, there was closed doors; where there was supposed to be compassion, there were conditions attached. </p>
  <p align="left"> If you have ever marched in a Hero parade, Devotion parade, or Mardi Gras, you will know what I mean. I remember vividly many years ago in Wellington, the Christians waving the banners, throwing the water balloons, and singing the National Anthem at my friends and I as we marched. I remember the shame and deep sorrow that I felt, knowing that my friends knew I shared the same God as the mockers, and fanatics. They may have intended to (in their own warped way) somehow communicate Gods Love, yet they communicated hatred and bigotry.</p>
  <p align="left"> Of course we have moved on from those days, haven&rsquo;t we? I don&rsquo;t think we have, I don&rsquo;t think we are as tolerant as we would like to be. I still hear &ldquo;of course we love them, we just don&rsquo;t love what they do&rdquo; What! No one ever said to me (when I was an unmarried practicing heterosexual-many years ago) &ldquo;of course Karl we love you, we just don&rsquo;t love what you do- even though I was doing it as a Jesus follower ( and a volunteer with YFC as well). No, people just kept telling me that &ldquo;they loved me, and that Christ still loved me- and that&rsquo;s the most important thing&rdquo;. If I had been &ldquo;practicing&rdquo; with men however, the conversation would have been somewhat different. </p>
  <p align="left">Yet in the midst of this mindset in the church, there are those who are not silent, there are those who speak with words of Love and acceptance. There are those who are willing to say &ldquo;We are sorry for the way the church, in the name of Christ, has treated you and your community&rdquo;. Most of us have heard of the 100 Revs and the message they will be carrying in this year&rsquo;s Mardi Gras (this Saturday), it is a message steeped in God&rsquo;s Love, and is guided by Gods hands. Darryl, Dave, Mal, and Phil (my brother in law) will be marching with the 100 Revs to show their (and our) support for them, and to also join in saying sorry to the GBLTI community.</p>
  <p align="left"> Join with me in praying for them, Mike Hercock and his team of organizers, and those with whom they march this Saturday. Please pray that God&rsquo;s hand would protect them, not from other marchers, but from sections of the church in Oz who have been very opposed to the 100 Revs, and have not been Christ like in their response to the 100 Revs. Mal, Dave, and Darryl, you go with our Love and prayers. May you enjoy Jesus, as you march alongside Him.</p>
