  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname|| </p>
  <p>Welcome to our last update before Surge.</p>
  <p>Firstly, a few points on the recent feedback you gave after the 'State of the Nation' was sent out. Thank you to all those who responded with thoughts on where we head as a movement from this point on. It was overwhelming clear from these responses that members wish to move forward in creating a mission order.</p>
  <p>This is a journey that is not undertaken lightly, nor is it a journey that will be easy for us. There are some areas of our corporate life that we will need to explore, and dialogue about; these are areas that have often been talked about in the past few years, but it is now time to make some decisions. These areas include the place of government funding, ageing up our programs, attracting others to the journey, the place of staff, our response to Te Tiriti O Waitangi and our journey with Tangatawhenua.</p>
  <p>We will read together, we will have input from others together, and at different times we will have the opportunity to travel and experience what others are doing in this area.</p>
  <p>Make no mistake, this journey will cost us- we need to say this from the outset. If we are truly serious about becoming a mission order, then we will end up looking and operating vastly different than we do now. Not for the sake of being different; but because the journey of Jesus demands us to a life of sacrifice, worship, and love. Jesus has brought us this far, imagine how much further He will take us.</p>
  <p>Each of you who sent in your written application for membership are accepted into the missional community of Incedo for the next two years. Over this time we will be forming and transforming ourselves with the aim of becoming an order of people living for God in intentional, prayerful, creative and generous ways.<br>
      <br>
      See you at Surge, where we will work / worship / eat / laugh / pray / party / fellowship / love together.<br>
  </p>

  <p>God Bless<br>
