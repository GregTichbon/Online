          <p align="left">This year the Gathering is in Rotorua at Lakeview Bible Camp, 15 minutes drive from central Rotorua.</p>
	        <p><a href="default.asp?page=swimming">http://www.biblecamp.org.nz/lakeview/directions.htm</a></p>
	        <p>We&rsquo;ve chosen to have a more informal relaxed year, where families and young people can have fun and participate too. We&rsquo;ve organised white water rafting on the worlds highest rafted waterfall, plus mountain biking, as well as all the delicious cafes that Rotorua offers.</p>
	        <p>The aim of the weekend is to get some traction on the focus groups, moving ideas, plans and possibilities for these going forward. The other aim is to relax with everyone, young and old, who attends this year's Gathering.</p>
	        <p>The cost is $120 for adults and $60 for young people. We want people at Lakeview by 8pm on Thursday night the 24th April, and we&rsquo;ll be all done by 2pm on Sunday the 27th April.</p>
	        <p>Bring: your bedding, (pillows &amp; mattresses provided), personal toiletries, warm clothes, outdoor &amp; river clothes. <br>
	          If you&rsquo;ve got a favorite mountain bike or outdoor adventure equipment bring it along... Any fun board games or outdoor games you&rsquo;re keen for us campers to partake in. Lastly, your inspiration and ideas related to the topic of your focus group.</p>
	        <p>We&rsquo;ll be emailing you individually to remind you of which focus group you&rsquo;re signed up to, plus each group will be responsible for a meal and duty over the weekend.</p>
	        <p>Please email <a href="mailto:taranaki@incedo.org.nz">taranaki@incedo.org.nz</a> to confirm your attendance and who else you plan to bring, plus any questions or requests you may have. We imagine that we&rsquo;ll have a diverse bunch of youth, families, couples and singles this year. Who could you invite?</p>
	        <p>Looking forward to connecting with everyone over ANZAC weekend.</p>
