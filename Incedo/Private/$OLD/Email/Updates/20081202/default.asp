  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left"> IMPORTANT READING</p>
  <p align="left"> What follows is a summary of points covered during my road trip around bases. It is vital that you read through this. Over the last couple of years, a number of bases have either gone ahead with inappropriate action (e.g. signing up for purchases without funds), failed to respond to requests for information, or ignored proper processes (e.g. staff appointments).</p>
  <p align="left">      We simply can't afford these sorts of thing, in the future. We don't want a lot of bureaucracy in Incedo, but that will only work if we all play our part.</p>
  <p align="left"> The following represents, in effect, a list of some Policy and Procedures.</p>
  <p align="left"> <strong>1. Finances</strong></p>
  <p align="left"> - Each base is either responsible for maintaining their own accounts, or supplying the information in an orderly format, on time, to Bryan.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> You are responsible to ensure you don't overspend or commit to purchases /events you cannot fund</li>
    <li> Requests to the MLT for assistance (with ongoing costs or events) will always be considered, but must be in advance and include a clear budget.</li>
    <li> We are all responsible for taking good care of Incedo assets (buildings, vehicles, equipment). These are not ours. We are stewards. They represent the generosity
          and sacrificial giving of many people.</li>
    <li> All Bases are expected to contribute to regular mission giving. You can donate either monthly to the Incedo a/c or to specific overseas mission(aries). You will receive an outline of options shortly. Please action it asap and the MLT by January what you will be doing in this regard, for next year.</li>
  </ul>  <p align="left"> <strong>2. Workers</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>  Except in a few specific cases of contracted workers (approved by MLT), no-one can receive funding for working in Incedo without being a member.</li>
    <li> No paid workers can be considered without first reading &quot;<a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/private/documents/default.asp?document=45">Working in Incedo</a>&quot;. No appointments can be approved without consulting the MLT. This 
          includes overseas workers coming to NZ.</li>
    <li> All workers and helpers are to be made familiar with our <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/private/documents/Requests.asp?document=34">Sexual Abuse Policy</a> (any complaints must be referred to the MLT/Board within 24 hours), Risk Assessment Procedures, and<a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/private/faq/#60"> x3 watch</a> computer monitoring requirements.</li>
  </ul>  <p align="left"> <strong>3. Pastoral Support</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>  All members commit to receiving and actioning the daily 3x3x3 prayer/reading texts; weekly prayer guide; and, where possible, joining with other members andhelpers for devotional practices and prayers.</li>
    <li> All members are to find prayer partners, and spiritual coaches.</li>
    <li> Members will be offered a range of &quot;shared experiences&quot; with other members. We expect prompt responses to such offers.</li>
    <li> Attendance at Surge and The Gathering is compulsory. Members are also expected to support the 'Converge' style events organised next year.</li>
  </ul>  <p align="left"> <strong>4. Communication</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>  Members are expected to regularly access the <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/private">Private Members</a> page in order to keep informed of news. &quot;I didn't know about it&quot; is not an acceptable 
          response in Incedo. Members should also provide, and update, their own <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/private/people/">details and profile</a> on the page; should read and contribute to the forums; and take initiative in providing news.</li>
    <li> The Incedo website also contains information about Incedo events. Members should make sure ministry events in their area, are publicised in the News &amp; Events page of the website. </li>
    </ul>
