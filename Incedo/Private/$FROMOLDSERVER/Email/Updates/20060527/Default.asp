  <p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>Just a quick update about CTC and Youth for Christ Conference (YFCC)</p>
  <p><strong>CTC</strong></p>
  <p>Tracy, Dave and the team have CTC under control. Lets remember to pray that God will connect with all of us there&hellip;..especially the young people that attend. Phil Cann will be speaking on the Saturday and Sunday so we need all members up for the appeal to help with counselling. Please don&rsquo;t wait and see if you are needed. Come straight up. If you are not needed we will let you know. It&rsquo;s not good when we don&rsquo;t have enough counsellors instantly on hand for such a special moment. We look forward to seeing you all there!</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>YFCC</strong></p>
  <p>This will be at Silverstream retreat centre again. We will all be staying in the lodge (2 beds per room). We will start Monday night at 7.00pm. The camp is not doing dinner so have your own before you arrive or bring pizza, fish and chips etc. You can arrive any time from 5.00pm onwards.</p>
  <p>As with last year the emphasis is on refreshment so along with Phil Cann speaking to us we will have some times of reflective worship, good coffee in the caf&eacute;, relaxing and some &lsquo;specialists that all members can meet with. These include 2 Drs (a male and female), a nutritionist, a physiotherapist and we are working on a hairdresser (dry cuts only) and financial advisor. You will get a free session with each of them if you want. </p>
  <p>We will also have a session on financial issues in YFC so we'll be looking at the whole issue of personal and ministry fundraising. In preparation please make sure you read the following: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The Henri Nouwen article &quot;the spirituality of fundraising&quot; which was e-mailed to every area earlier this year. (Download a version <a href="20060527/NOUWEN_Spirituality_Fund_Raising.pdf">here</a>) </p>
    <p>2. The Marfell newsletter sent out by Glenn 2 weeks ago week. Contact Glenn if you need another copy <a href="mailto:taranaki@yfc.org.nz">taranaki@yfc.org.nz</a> </p>
    <p>3. The excerpt at end of this update (from Maureen in Wellington) taken from the letter sent to supporters with their annual tax receipts. </p>
  </blockquote>  <p>This info will be essential background for the session at YFC conference. </p>
  <p><strong>We need to know if you are coming for catering purposes. Please email Darryl <a href="mailto:d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a> who is coming. </strong></p>
  <p>Cost is $75.00 per adult. Kids rates are about half of that. You need to bring your own bedding&hellip;.you should have that from CTC!</p>
  <p>We finish after lunch on Wednesday. You can fly out any time after 3.00pm.</p>
  <p>Let Darryl know if you have any questions <a href="mailto:d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a> </p>
  <p>God Bless you all and we look forward to spending some time together</p>
  <p>Paul, Julie, Gus, and Darryl <A

  <hr>  <p><em>Dear </em></p>
  <p><em>We are continually grateful for your financial support during the year ended 31st March 2006. </em></p>
  <p><em>As some of you maybe aware, Youth for Christ Nationally is going through major changes and re-structuring. From being quite separate centers with individual local governing boards, to a nationwide mission order with one Nationwide board. YFC has redefined itself as a mission and has introduced a new leadership framework along with new values and practices. This will help move YFC forward as a dynamic youth mission, and recapture the edginess for which YFC has historically been known . </em></p>
  <p><em>As always the opportunities we face, remain beyond our ability to meet, and every gift helps us bridge that gap. It also gives further encouragement to our staff and volunteer teams who always give far beyond the call of duty in the time and effort they put in. </em></p>
  <p><em>Yours sincerely</em><br>
