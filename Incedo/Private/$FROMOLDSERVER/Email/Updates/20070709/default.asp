  <p align="center"><strong><font size="+1">Update for July 2007</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||  </p>
  <p>A bit of a long update but containing some important information such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Converge reminders</li>
    <li> A great pamphlet from Rory</li>
    <li> Prizes</li>
    <li> This months Bible reading</li>
  </ul>  
  <p><strong>Kiwisaver<br>
  </strong>Your Kiwisaver pack has been mailed to you and if you have any little questions you can get in touch with <a href="mailto:d.gardiner@incedo.org.nz">Darryl</a> or if you have any big questions, Mark McKenzie.</p>
  <p><strong>Incedo Email</strong><br>
    You have probably received an email from Greg  about the new Incedo email addreses. These are on the way. Please follow the instructions emailed by Greg. </p>
  <p><strong>Converge</strong><br>
    Reminder of Converge dates - North Island - August 10-12 at Lake Taupo Christian Camp and South Island - August 24-26 at Spencer Park. </p>
  <p>Please REGISTER by emailing <a href="mailto:k.dickson@incedo.org.nz">Karl</a> (north) or <a href="mailto:p.keane@incedo.org.nz">Paul</a> (south). The cost is $75.00.</p>
  <p> The gift table will be done a bit differently this time. Instead of bringing a gift for the table, please prayerfully bring any ideas of a need that you or someone you track with has. During Converge another Incedo member may take your &lsquo;need&rsquo; and agree to meet it, or help to. Trying something different! Let us know what you think afterwards.</p>
  <p><strong>Gathering 2008<br>
  </strong>Does anyone want to host the gathering next year? (First weekend of the July school holidays.) We thought it could be a good idea to change the venue and have a different flavour and kaupapa for the Gathering next year. Thoughts, suggestions and offers to host can be given to your friendly MLT.</p>
  <p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions Pamphlet</strong><br>
    Rory has created a <a href="FAQ-Incedo.pdf">pamphlet</a> (attached) that you can use as you like. Its great stuff and you can change the details on the back for your own use. Sterling! Cheers Rory.</p>
  <p><strong>Getting in touch with MLT</strong><br>
    While you can feel free to email any one of the MLT, the initial contact person for the MLT is Karl. You can cc your emails to Julie and Paul as well (or simply email to <a href="mailto:mlt@incedo.org.nz">mlt@incedo.org.nz</a>) but it will likely be Karl who answers. Speaking of answering emails, 2-3 days is a likely time for a response as it usually takes that long for us to get in touch and chat things over. If you have something that urgently needs a reply, give Karl a call. None of the MLT are in an office every day to check emails, so thanks for your patience with email replies and remember &ndash; call if urgent.</p>
  <p><strong>Vacancies</strong><br>
    There are vacancies open in Timaru Incedo and <a href="mailto:p.keane@incedo.org.nz">Paul</a> would love to hear from you.</p>
  <p><strong>Prize</strong><br>
    There is a prize going out to the fifth person to email <a href="mailto:p.keane@incedo.org.nz">Paul</a> and tell him you've read this entire update. It's a good prize too. </p>
  <p><strong>Practices</strong><br>
    If you would like to read the &quot;practices feedback&quot; from the gathering, just email <a href="mailto:k.dickson@incedo.org.nz">Karl</a> for a copy&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>July Bible Reading</strong><br>
    The 
    Bible reading this month is Acts. A rocking good read.</p>
  <p>Go well and God bless. See you at a Converge near you!</p>
