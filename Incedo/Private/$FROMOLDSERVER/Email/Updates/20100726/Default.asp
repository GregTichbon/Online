  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>I apologize at the get-go, this update is more akin to a novel than our emails of the past; we have a few things to cover, so&hellip;grab a coffee/tea/beer (if it&rsquo;s that time of the day)/or chai, log off FB and settle down for an update of epic proportions (not Gone with the Wind epic..it&rsquo;s more like the once a letter email from people overseas).</p>
  <p>So you can skip to the parts you want to read first; here is a brief table of contents-</p>
  <ol>
    <li> The Gathering</li>
    <li> The Incedo New Initiative Fund </li>
    <li> Incedo and YFCI- Just friends or heading down the aisle?</li>
  </ol>  <p>1. As you are aware The Gathering is happening in Chch from 24 to 29 September. More details will follow, but we just want to give a heads up in a couple of areas in advance. Please let Tracy (<a href="mailto:t.bedford@incedo.org.nz">t.bedford@incedo.org.nz</a>) know how many will arrive and when- please do this by 1 September. This will enable the team to plan and allow Tracy plenty of time to arrange the numbers with the campsite. The cost for this year is $149 for adults and $139 for children. We recognize that this combined with the cost of transport may be prohibitive for some- we do not want this to be the case. Please let us know if there is any way we can assist with getting you (and your family if applicable) to the Gathering, we would rather spend money to have people there than miss out on a great time together. This year will be different than previous years; we have someone lined up to give some input over a couple of days, as well as a team of people getting creative to ensure a great/deep/fun time for us all. We will hear stories from each other, we will hear about the next season of Incedo, and we will have our AGM. There will also be some people attending who have journeyed with Incedo in various forms and are keen to explore us on a bit of deeper level, as well as a couple more people from o/seas. It marks a great step for us as a community, knowing that there are people who are keen explore a deeper connection with us. As I said earlier, there will be more details to follow&hellip;..</p>
  <p>2. The Board and MLT have a real desire to see new/creative/innovative/crazy expressions of our values in our various communities. We would love to see people trying (and even failing) to flesh out their new dreams as members of Incedo. We also recognize that it is getting harder to find funding to try new ideas, especially ideas that reflect our values. So that end, we have set aside $100,000 dollars as the Incedo New Initiative Fund (INIF-flash aye?). The key word in all of this is new; the &ldquo;fund&rdquo; is not there to give into existing programs/expressions of our values, it is for people to explore new dreams/ideas that must express Incedo&rsquo;s values.</p>
  <p>What are the criteria you ask? Well they are quite simple: A. The &ldquo;idea&rdquo; must be new, B. You must have shared this idea with 2 other members and spent time praying with them about this, C. The &ldquo;idea&rdquo; must express the values of Incedo, D. You have explored local funding options, and found there are no options. </p>
  <p>What is the reporting/accountability criteria- They would be the same as any Incedo program/event that you would normally run. We want to encourage dreaming and exploring new/fresh expressions, we are not so concerned with the numbers who attended, the number of salvations, or amount of coverage in the local paper. If at the end of the process you have tried, expressed our values, and committed no major crime we will celebrate with you. If your idea takes off and is the greatest thing since sliced bread and attracts more funding, we will not ask for any money back. Go dream/create/try/fail/laugh/cry and know that Incedo will be with you. Final approval does rest with the Board and MLT, and we will dialogue with people throughout the process.</p>
  <p>3. I sent out an update earlier this year outlining &ldquo;where things were at&rdquo; with Youth For Christ International (YFCI). Neil and Dave (YFC Asia Pacific) came and spent a few days with some from the MLT and Board in Hamilton. Besides the fact that Blair and I were pining for the V8&rsquo;s racing at the same time and in the same city (in fact next to one caf&eacute; where we met for a while), our time with them was good. There was frank and honest conversation around a number of areas, the main one being &ldquo;how do we fit with YFCI now that we are no longer YFCNZ?&rdquo; As a result of that meeting, emails, and a Skype call thrown in for good measure (plus wanting to keep this update as short as possible) Incedo has been moved from a being a fully chartered member of YFCI to being an associate member. The three main reasons for being moved are the following; A. The size of our board does not meet the requirements of YFCI, B. We do not use the logo of YFCI anywhere, C. We do not agree to the unifying essentials.</p>
  <p>We can potentially become a fully chartered member nation by doing the following; A. We agree to have the YFCI logo somewhere on our Incedo logo (to acknowledge our connection with YFCI) and B. Agree to the unifying essentials. We need to decide whether we want explore having the YFCI logo somewhere on our logo; this is a decision that the MLT and Board are keen to hear your views on.</p>
  <p>The reality will be that if we choose to have the logo, we can continue our journey as part of YFCI and discovering what part we have to play (and they are keen for our voice to be heard). If we choose not to use the YFCI logo, this will effectively end our &ldquo;legal&rdquo; relationship with YFCI. </p>
  <p>I have heard from some on this issue, and would appreciate any views that you have; this was not placed on the member&rsquo;s forum as we want people to be able to share their honest views without the worry of healthy debate taking place over what they have written. If the members of Incedo feel it is time to end our season with YFCI then the MLT and Board will take that into account in our dialogue with YFCI; and likewise, if the members of Incedo want to explore using the YFCI logo somewhere on the Incedo logo.</p>
  <p>This is a big step in our journey with YFCI, and maybe the biggest decision that we have made in our long history with them; but it is a decision we have to make and we want to ensure we hear the heart of Incedo on this one. Please email me your thoughts ASAP, and I will update people as soon as the MLT and Board make a decision.</p>
  <p>Well here we are&hellip;.the end. Christian culture dictates that I end with some deep quote, or piece of scripture&hellip;but I won&rsquo;t. I just want to finish by saying..</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fin&rdquo;</p>
