			<p>What an eventful few weeks it has been ... The RWC, Election issues, Surge in Hamilton etc, etc... 
			  We hope that as you turn your attention to a wide-range of end-of year/Christmas preparations, you can put the kettle on, put your feet up and read/respond to the information in this update.</p>
			<p><strong>2012 Dates for Incedo Members</strong><br>
		      <em>The Gathering Weekend:</em><br>
		      Friday 29 June - Tuesday 3 July</p>
			<p><em>Membership and Discernment Weekend:</em><br>
		  Friday 28 September - Monday 1 October</p>
			<p><em>Surge Revisited Weekend:</em> <br>
			  with the Hamilton Refugee/Migrant Community and Incedo<br>
		  Friday 10 August - Sunday 12 August</p>
			<p><strong>Surge 2011</strong><br>
		      Attached is a letter of appreciation from Rachel, thanking Incedo for a fantastic time in Hamilton during our Surge weekend. Please <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20111128/SurgeLetterFromRachel.pdf">download here</a>. </p>
			<p>Many thanks to Gus, Marg and the Waikato crew for all the background/preparation work and the hosting of Surge in October. To quote 17 year old Blaide: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best camp I&rsquo;ve ever been on&rdquo;.</p>
		  <p>As a result of our Surge involvement, another opportunity for Incedo to serve/support the Refugees and Migrant Community will take place during 2012. We would like to encourage you and your young people to join the team in Hamilton during 10-12 August.</p>
			<p><strong>Focus Groups</strong><br>
		      As discussed during our Surge weekend, we would like to encourage everyone to become involved with an Incedo focus group. The idea is for several members to champion a focus topic, involving non members and appropriate 'others' to help in developing concepts and ideas on how Incedo could move forward on the focus group themes. The themes are: <em>Homosexuality - Surge/Service projects - Young People as our focus - Membership and connection - Incedo and the Treaty</em>.</p>
			<p>Expectations would be that you'd connect with your fellow groupies over the coming weeks/months via email, Skype and face to face. You'd then present during our Gathering in July, concepts and themes around what your topic could express/mean for Incedo into the future. </p>
		  <p>Please contact Glen if you're interested in being part of one or more of these groups or if you would like more information. This is a great opportunity to connect with other Incedo members, focus on some key issues during 2012 and a chance to bring others into Incedo's creative conversations.</p>
			<p><strong>YFCI Framework</strong><br>
		  Youth for Christ International has indicated that they're actively pursuing the formation of Youth for Christ here in New Zealand. They've gone as far as appointing a Board chairperson, Ian Grant and he's in the process of recruiting Board members. The Board of Incedo has had limited communication with YFCI around this process, and it was with some surprise that YFCI have made this move so soon after we were de-chartered earlier in the year. Incedo wants to remain open about what YFCI is doing and even though there is frustration and some disappointment around the process, we feel it&rsquo;s important to reflect the values and heart of Incedo. There maybe further ramifications for us, as a result of YFC restarting in New Zealand. Therefore the Board has appointed Glen to be the official spokesperson for Incedo on YFCI developments, so please pass on any enquires, Press requests or concerned supporters correspondence to Glen. Yes, you're welcome to have conversations with people about this, but direct any official approaches to Glen.</p>
			<p><strong>Welcome to Dave</strong><br>
		      We would like to welcome Mr White to the MLT. Unfortunately we can't provide him with an official car park, Incedo credit card or VIP seats at the V8 Supercar race in Hamilton next year.</p>
		  <p> ... We're really glad that Dave has chosen to take up the responsibility of being a part of Incedo's Mission leadership at this time. With his refreshing creative approach to Faith, Life-style Mission &amp; Community connection, Dave will focus on the expression of our values/mission in 21st Century Aotearoa.</p>
			<p><strong>SPENDING OVER $1,000</strong><br>
		  Please remember to touch base with the MLT if you are spending over $1,000 on any item. And a reminder: don&rsquo;t spend money you do not have or are not certain you will get. This includes signing agreements to purchase or hire without being certain you can fund them. As a nation-wide mission, we are all accountable to each other ... what you do, has an effect on all of us.</p>
			<p><strong>AGM &amp; SGM</strong><br>
	      Due to Incedo's constitution requirements we were unable to have our AGM as planned at Surge this year. Darryl worked hard on making amendments to our constitution which were approved at Incedo's Special General Meeting in late October. Thanks Darryl for all your hard work. You would have all received copies of the constitution proposed changes which were all ratified at this meeting. Our AGM was then held on the 12th November in Auckland. We had our required 50% of members present with Greg beaming in via Skype, which we're now able to do with the constitutional changes. Thanks to everyone who was able to attend the AGM, and yes we did miss the rest of you! We've attached a copy of the AGM minutes for your information, please <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20111128/AGMMinutes2011.pdf">download here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Skype Connection</strong><br>
		  As mentioned several months ago now, we're keen to begin a regular Skype prayer connection with everyone. From the 1st December there will be weekly reflective Skype calls. They'll be Tuesday's at 6.30am and Thursday's at 9.30pm. We expect these connections to last around 20 to 30 minutes utilizing a Lectio Divina, prayer focus style format. Glen, Tracy and Dave will host these until Christmas and then we'll begin them again in late January and also arrange for a members-roster to host each week&rsquo;s Skype connection. (Search for Incedo Connect in your Skype account).</p>
			<p>We look forward to hearing from you regarding involvement with the Focus groups, and catching-up with you, during our Skype Prayer connections, beginning Thursday 1st December. </p>
		  <p>God Bless,</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p> Glen, Tracy, Dave<br>
