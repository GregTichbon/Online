<p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
<p>Please read the e-mail below (which has been sitting in my inbox for the past 6 months - sorry). Please think about something you could write to Andrew about telling him how you are connecting with young people in NZ. And, if you are aged somewhere around 20 years old, please send Andrew and e-mail introducing yourself so he can talk with you about what it's like being 20 and in YFC (something I've long since forgotten).<br>
    <br>
    Thanks<br>
    <br>
    Mal</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">My name is andrew mendy and i am a volunteer with youth for christ in the gambia. i am 20m years old and i am a gambian. i decided to write to you to fimilarise my self with you and to know about youth for christ activities in other countries.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">We are doing our best in the gambia in the area of school evangelism and youthe evangelism and God has really kept us going.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">I would be really glad to hear from you and to know how you operate and some of your activities and how you plan because it will help us aswell to draw new strategies of making Jesus known to many as you know gambia is muslim dorminated and alot of people dont know Christ.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">I would also be gald if you will be able to link me up to young people like me in the YFC so that we can talk and share experiences and make friends and seek how we can form a link between the two groups and exchange visits if possible.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">I would be gald to hear from you and May God continue to bless you.</font></p>
