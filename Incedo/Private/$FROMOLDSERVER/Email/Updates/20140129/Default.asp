	        <p align="left">It&rsquo;s been a whirlwind end to 2013 and start to 2014! I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;ve had plenty going on. </p>
	        <p align="left">We trust that you've had moments to wonder at the symbolism of God with us over this festive season.</p>
	        <p align="left">The MLT has been trying to juggle dates and have managed only this past week to confirm details of this years Incedo get togethers. Apologies for the lateness of the dates, but we&rsquo;ve had to make some changes to fit the different options in.</p>
	        <p align="left"><span class="style1">A Different Conversation and the 100 Revs</span> at the Sydney Mardi Gras is coming up during the last weekend of February. Mal Green is heading over to support Mike and the team at Imagine with these events. Are you keen or do you know someone who could head over to support this mission? The MLT is offering $300 towards travel costs if you&rsquo;re keen to attend and support these initiatives. </p>
	        <p align="left">Email the MLT if you&rsquo;ve wanting to take up this offer. <a href="mailto:mlt@incedo.org.nz">mlt@incedo.org.nz</a> </p>
	        <p align="left"><span class="style1">The Gathering</span> this year is in Rotorua from Thursday evening the 24th April until Sunday afternoon the 27th April. This will be a family friendly gathering, utilising the outdoor activities and other options that Rotorua has to offer.</p>
	        <p align="left">The Gathering this year will be based around the focus groups that people have signed up to. The Gathering will create space for focus groups to work on their different topics, amongst enjoying the activities Rotorua has to offer.</p>
	        <p align="left">More information regarding the Gathering will be out shortly.</p>
	        <p align="left"><span class="style1">Surge 14</span> Sam Chapman believes in peoples' capacity to change, and with this belief he has helped to transform individuals and entire communities.</p>
	        <p align="center"> <img width="307" height="169" src="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20140129/SamChapman.jpg"></p>
	        <p align="left">              Sam works with those that society has largely forgotten; providing a helping hand to gang members and ex-justice clients. Through personal empowerment Sam has helped people learn basic life skills and recognise and develop their gifts. This nurtured sense of purpose and self-belief has helped individuals completely transform their lives.</p>
	        <p align="left">Sam grew up in a Maori community where sharing was part of day to day life. It is these values and this belief system that Sam draws on in his work. He has formalised this (the AWHI model) and uses this process with people from all different walks of life.</p>
	        <p align="left">Sam and his wife Thelma co-founded the Houhango Rongo Trust in 1989 and the Awhi Foundation in 2008, reflecting the couple's strong commitment to empowering individuals and families. Central to their work is their belief in the importance of the family home - their own home is open to anyone who needs it.</p>
	        <p align="left"> <img width="638" height="291" src="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20140129/Turangi2.jpg"><br>
</p>
	        <p align="left">This year's Surge is totally retro. We are back to the paint roller and brush. We have the honor of serving a legends in ministry : Sam and Thelma Chapman. They have recently moved back to tribal land and have taken over a maternity hospital in TURANGI. There are many rooms in this hospital that Sam is preparing for us !! and the many rooms need a lick of paint to make hospitable to the many peoples from around the world and NZ that wish to come and be encouraged and learn from Sam and Thelma. </p>
	        <p align="left">There is plenty of accommodation on site !</p>
	        <p align="left"> It would be awesome if we could all make the classic and compulsory 3 day SURGE weekend - FRIDAY/SAT/SUN 3 to 5 October, but then MLT also envisages a WEEK long option (young people and whoever) where people could do a mix of mahi and Turangi adventure options MON - SUN 29 September to 5 October.</p>
	        <p align="left">Note - If you know builders that might want to join your crew for the weekend - think now :)</p>

	        <p align="left"><span class="style1">Brian McLaren</span> is visiting New Zealand over Easter this year. He'll be visiting a city near you. Let Glen know if you are interested in helping in your area as we've been asked to support his visit anyway we can.</p>
	        <p align="left">So that's the state of the nation address for now. Our prayer for 2014 is that we innovate and be open to the possibility of new and exciting things that our Creator has for us.</p>
	        <p align="left">Be well, be motivated, be in love with the Jesus story and the possibilities He has for you.<br>
