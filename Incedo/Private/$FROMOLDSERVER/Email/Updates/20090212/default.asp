  <p align="left"><strong>MLT UPDATE</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Shalom ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left"> You gotta love updates&hellip; don&rsquo;t worry this will be short and to the point. We feel in the mood for some Strategic Action Bullet Points. So here we go&hellip;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It is with great excitement that we can tell you that Hannah Bruce (all the way from the mighty Timaru) has been appointed to the Leadership Team of Incedo. Hannah brings a fresh perspective, to the team and also to the three boys. She is the right person to come onto the team, and Hannah feels it is also the right time. This is an exciting step for us as a community, as well as for Hannah.<br>
    </li>
    <li> We spent last weekend with a few &ldquo;New Schoolers&rdquo; down in Christchurch (big ups to Tracy for the fantastic/historic/slightly creepy at night house). This was a great time of laughter, prayer, reflection, Val Kilmer, dreaming, talking, food, and looking forward. We are privileged to have in Incedo, a group of people who are willing to take a lead/dream/love/challenge/ in different areas of the Incedo community. We have already seen this in action with the email Andy sent out on Monday, and there are other plans in the pipeline. <br>
    </li>
    <li> There is a good history of people coming from different parts of the world to spend time serving with us here in NZ. As we evolved as Incedo, we have realised that we need to revisit how the process works. This is not a reflection on how we have done it, but we do need to tighten up the process so that it is beneficial for all people involved. As was mentioned at The Gathering last year, The MLT must approve any application from anyone wishing to spend time in NZ serving with Incedo- this ensures that they fully understand how we &ldquo;operate&rdquo;, and what we expect from them. Anyone spending time here will be expected to operate as a member, and will received updates, and the 3x3x3. Any applications to spend time in NZ must be made to the MLT, its not that we wish to exert any control, we simply want to have a uniform practice in place.<br>
    </li>
    <li> Big thanks and much respect to the following: Kelly- for the classy, thought provoking, and sometimes odd videos that grace the Incedo page on a Monday; Greg- for all the computer interweb stuff, the members page, and sending out the updates; Mike W- for ensuring we get the 3x3x3 bible verses; Glen &ndash; for the prayer updates; Gus, Tracy, and Blair- for serving us on the board; Bryan and Rochelle- for all they do so that we don&rsquo;t get into trouble over $$; All those who comment on the forum- they keep our brains active. <br>
    </li>
    <li> Lastly, thanks for taking the time to read this update.</li>

  <p><strong>GATHERING</strong></p>
  <p>I've got some good news and some absolutely unbelievably incredible news for you. First off, the dates for this year's Gathering have been set (Yay!!!), they are the 25th to the 27th September 2009. Secondly, and here comes the bestestest bit........IT'S GONNA BE IN NELSON! TA DA!!! Told you it was good. :)</p>
  <p> We're holding it at Bridge Valley Adventure Centre. More details will follow in the coming weeks, but for now, I need you to start thinking about if you'll be there or not (pretty silly question really cos who wouldn't want to come to Nelson). Please can you get back to me ASAP on whether you'll be there and numbers-wise on family members accompanying too.</p>
  <p>      Costings for the food and accomodation part of the weekend are below. We'll need to decide as a community (funny how that word keeps cropping up in Incedo messages lately) as to whether we go for the standard or deluxe catering options. So maybe on your rsvp, indicate which you're up for and if there's a large consensus towards deluxe (highly unlikely cos we're all broke youth workers) then we'll head in that direction. If it's half and half or leaning towards standard then we'll go with standard. The food there is really good, whatever option we go for, so don't think that standard means bread, water and peas as a staple diet for the weekend. Deluxe just means extra extra yum yum. </p>
  <p> Any questions give me a call, email, carrier pigeon messgage or telepathic thought. Sorry, I can't accept semaphore anymore. </p>
  <p> Cheers</p>

  <p> p.s. Just a reminder, we're still keen on that staff road trip around the South Island. How about we head off from the Gathering? Let me know if you're keen.<br>

  <p><strong>DAILY PRAYERS</strong><br>
    <br>
    Over the last couple of years, we have explored the idea of a daily recited prayer as one small way of expressing unity across Incedo. The idea is that if, on any particular day, you are meeting with other Incedo people, you say that days prayer together. If you're on your own, you pray the prayer in solidarity with Incedo members nationwide.<br>
    <br>
      Here's 5 prayers for 2009<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Monday</strong> (Joy Cowley)<br>
      <br>
      Jesus<br>
      You are the Way<br>
      The bridge between Heaven and Earth<br>
      between the smallness of self<br>
      and the greatness of God<br>
      You are the path we choose to follow<br>
      and can never lose,<br>
      because it resides in our hearts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen.</p>
  <p> <strong>Tuesday</strong> (adapted from Ruth Graham)<br>
        <br>
        God of the Universe<br>
        Whose Son endured death<br>
        and defied death<br>
        We find our leaden spirits<br>
        lifted from the dust<br>
        confident that You,<br>
        who has brought us so far<br>
        on Your way<br>
        will see us through.</p>
  <p> <strong>Wednesday</strong> (from Theodotus, AD 304)<br>
          <br>
          Lord Jesus<br>
          Creator of Heaven and Earth<br>
          you will never abandon us<br>
          you are preparing us to live in your kingdom<br>
          you are strengthening us to overcome<br>
        and we give you thanks</p>
  <p> <strong>Thursday</strong> (adapted from Walter Bruggemann)<br>
          <br>
          Lord<br>
          push us beyond ourselves<br>
          in <u>wonder</u> at your ways<br>
          in <u>love</u> for the world you love<br>
          in <u>praise</u> that transforms our fears<br>
          push us beyond ourselves<br>
        towards you.</p>
  <p> <strong>Friday</strong> (adapted from Dietrich Bonhoeffer)<br>
          <br>
          Jesus<br>
          In us there may be darkness<br>
          but in you there is light<br>
          we may be lonely<br>
          but you do not leave us<br>
          weak in spirit<br>
          but with you there is hope<br>
          restless<br>
          but in you there is peace<br>
          we may not understand<br>
          but you know the way<br>
        Enable us to live in you.</p>

  <p><strong>EXPRESSIONS / TALENT QUESTS </strong></p>
  <p> Northland is having a great time with Expressions as a stand alone event that works great in our Northland community. We would like to carry on with Expressions in our area. Regardless of no CTC or Fuse. I'm interested in networking with the mission bases or people that are keen in doing something similar for young people in there own area. Or would you like to assist us in running ours in Northland.</p>
  <p>So far I guess there is a Expressions in South Auckland and Belenhiem. Are there any other bases doing anything?</p>
  <p>Please contact me <br>
