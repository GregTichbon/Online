  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>We are committed followers of Jesus, inviting all young people to join our faith adventure</strong> &hellip; During a prayer time at the Gathering Sue shared an image of White Water Rafting. It&rsquo;s an exciting and challenging image. Maybe, referring to both the purpose of our mission, and the creative expression of our namesake, Incedo: to go, to move forward. </p>
  <p align="center"><strong>    TO BOLDLY GO</strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>MLT changes</strong>: Karl has resigned from the MLT and Sarah is taking a break that currently includes a sailing trip for the next month. If you do want to contact the MLT, the email address is: <a href="mailto:mlt@incedo.org.nz">mlt@incedo.org.nz</a>. For any urgent matters please inform Glen asap by phone: 027 438 9052. </p>
  <p><strong>Police Check Forms</strong>: Following our discussion at The Gathering about Police checks, we all need to have a current check (less than 2 years old). We ask that everyone completes a new check now, even if yours is recent. Then we can put a reminder out every 2 years so we all stay up to date. So please <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20101101/PoliceVettingForm.doc">download</a> and fill out the  form and send to Mal at Incedo, P.O. Box 34552, Birkenhead, North Shore City 0746. He&rsquo;ll do the rest. Please note that this applies to all key volunteers who have responsibility for looking after young people regularly as part of an Incedo activity. And when a new volunteer starts remember they need to be police checked.<br>
    <strong>ACTION: Please return forms, asap and by Tuesday 30th November.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>X3 Watch Internet accountability</strong>: As discussed at the Gathering all Incedo computers need to re-install the X3 Watch. Go to <a href="http://x3watch.com">http://x3watch.com</a> and follow the instructions for the free version i.e accountability version. Our Incedo x3 Watch Angels are Sue: <a href="mailto:s.gardiner@incedo.org.nz">s.gardiner@incedo.org.nz</a> and Marg:<a href="mailto:m.row@hotmail.com"> m.row@hotmail.com</a><br>
    ACTION: Please have this completed by Monday 8th November. It only takes a few minutes.</p>
  <p>New Initiative Fund: This is where the raft trip hits the exciting and unpredictable white water! Remember Incedo has committed $100,000 to fund new ideas and initiatives. So far the MLT has approved 4 initiatives from this fund. Here are a couple of inspirational initiatives.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>BITTSA &ndash; 'Bugger it's time to start again'. An underground website that's a rallying point for people who believe Christianity is past its used-by date. A site where people can share left field proactive ideas and actions, plus dialogue with other activists who are challenging the status quo of Christianity.</p>
    <p>Radio Stone Soup &ndash; A recently new initiative that needs a cash injection to help build the great outlet that it is offering the community, run by the community, for the community. Funding will help with equipment, plus forming a connection with Wave FM and Jason Bloor, including help with volunteer training.</p>
  </blockquote>  <p>Thanks Gus and Greg, for your creative thinking and motivation, for taking up the challenge of tackling the grade 5 white water, experience. </p>
  <p>Let us know if you have an innovative &lsquo;new&rsquo; initiative. It's as easy as sending a simple outline via email to the MLT.</p>
  <p><strong>Coming Up: </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li> Truth Safe with Bart Campolo: 2-3 November</li>
    <li>Whanganui Retreat: 19-21 November </li>
  </ul>  <p> <strong>2011 Dates:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Gathering: 15-19 July</li>
    <li>Surge: 7-10 October<br>
    </li>
  </ul>  <p>Thanks everyone for being on this white water adventure. Together, we're all part of Incedo and each one of us plays a role in making Incedo what it is and more importantly what it is becoming. Some of us aren't afraid to point the raft in the direction of the extreme rapids which is a real challenge for those of us who like to play it safe. We're all in the raft so let's continue encouraging and supporting one another on our Faith adventure.</p>
  <p>... Take the thousand and give it to the one who risked the most. And get rid of this &quot;play-it-safe&quot; who won't go out on a limb. Matthew 25.</p>
  <p>Love your work,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>      Glen, Tracy &amp; Sarah<br>
