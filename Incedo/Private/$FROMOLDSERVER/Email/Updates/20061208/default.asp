  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">    It is now December and we are well into celebrating Advent .God coming to earth in the form of a baby to a single mum ... fantastic.  God came vulnerable, powerless and into the poor of the world ... what an example for us.</p>
  <p><strong>Readings</strong></p>
  <p>The reading for December is Luke. It&rsquo;s a good time to focus on Jesus incarnation amongst us all. There will be no update for January so the reading will be 2 Timothy ... chapter 2 focuses on the incarnation.</p>
  <p><strong>North Island Converge</strong></p>
  <p>We have confirmed the dates for the North Island Converge ... focusing on associates and helpers etc. It will be at Lake Taupo Christian Camp from Friday 10 August to Sunday 12 August. See the bottom of this update for a full list of dates in 2007.</p>
  <p><strong>Ethos weekends</strong></p>
  <p>The dates are confirmed although we will let you know the venues later. Make sure you book it in because if you are not at one of these you cannot be member after the next Gathering.</p>
  <p><strong>MLT change</strong></p>
  <p>Gus has stepped down from the MLT as at the end of November but accepted an appointment to the Board until the next Gathering when he will reassess. We wouldn&rsquo;t be where we are today without his input and it's good to see that in the new YFC people can step aside from leadership and yet still be a member, whereas in the past people left. Mal has done this already (from the MLT) Dave Treeby and Mark Campbell (from the Board) and all are still members. </p>
  <p><strong>Members&rsquo; forum</strong></p>
  <p>There has been a new article pasted to the members&rsquo; forum. Make sure you have a read and comment. <a href="http://www.membersforum.org.nz">www.membersforum.org.nz</a> Any problems etc contact Rory on <a href="mailto:r.grant@yfc.org.nz">r.grant@yfc.org.nz</a></p>
  <p><strong>Prayer update</strong></p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s amazing to get the weekly prayer update. Good to pray specifically but also really encouraging to hear what is going on around the place. Make sure we all keep using it to pray and to get prayer!</p>
  <p><strong>Review of Progress</strong></p>
  <p>You may recall that as part of the decision to make the radical changes we made, Wayne Kirkland (the latest article on the members forum is from Wayne) and Mic Duncan did a tour of NZ and wrote a report which became part of the catalyst for change. The MLT and Board have asked them to do an update on where we are now based on their initial report. They will start this in the new year and it will be presented to the Gathering in June. If they contact you you now know why!</p>
  <p><strong>Finally...</strong></p>
  <p>Thanks heaps for being in this with us over the past year. There have been struggles, failures and some good stories along the way but we have been there together trying to work out how to be Jesus people and to invite others to join our faith adventure. Who knows what next year will bring but we do hold to the truth that Jesus Christ is the same, today, yesterday and forever (Hebrews 13:8)</p>
