<p>Hi ||usefirstname||</p>
<p>Just a quick update for all Youth for Christ members.</p>
<p><strong>OCTOBER GOSPEL</strong></p>
<p>The Gospel for October is Luke.  24 chapters all written by a Physician. (<a href="http://www.yfc.org.nz/private/bible/book.asp?book=Luke">http://www.yfc.org.nz/private/bible/book.asp?book=Luke</a>) </p>
<p><strong>DAILY COMMUNITY DEVOTION</strong></p>
<p>Travelling around the country gives us (The MLT) a unique snapshot of YFC.  One of the encouraging things is seeing and participating in the daily YFC devotional guide office workers are all following which means that every Tuesday volunteers are prayed for all around NZ and that each Wednesday the whole country is prayed for.  Wanganui have a good system where one person reads out an item from the weekly prayer update and the next person prays for that issue and so on around the room.</p>
<p><strong>WORKER NEWS</strong></p>
<p>Greg Tichbon is on a three month sabbatical (long service leave) so is not really contactable till December.  We want all staff to have a 3month sabbatical every seven years or so and Greg is long overdue.</p>
<p>Jo McGrath is leaving YFC South Auckland after many years to follow her dream of becoming a counsellor.</p>
<p><strong>DATES FOR 2006</strong></p>
<p>We have made a date change as we had Converge too close to the Gathering and we want to pace the year better. We will now have North Island Converge from the 21st – 23rd July at Lake Taupo Christian Camp.  We hope to have SI Converge around the same time but will confirm this once we get the campsite confirmed.  The plan is that the Gathering (10-12 February in Wellington) is where all members get together and then around the middle of the year we get together as North and South Islands.  All these dates are posted on the website. <a href="http://www.yfc.org.nz">www.yfc.org.nz</a></p>
<p><strong>DISCUSSION FORUMS</strong></p>
<p> We are aware that there is a need for ongoing dialogue around a number of issues so as part of this we are going to start some online discussion forums.  We will have 4 – 6 articles posted and a discussion board for each one that is available to all members.  The initial subjects will include such topics as what is evangelism today, issues we face in reaching the culture, and follow on from the consults etc.  We will let you know when these are ready.</p>
<p>We are also going to set up some “Open Source Theology" discussion groups based on Andrew Perriman's article on "Rules of Engagement." (This article is available from Mal if you want a copy on <a href="mailto:m.green@yfc.org.nz">m.green@yfc.org.nz</a> )  This will involve 7 small groups developing a Biblical foundation for our mission statement and our 6 values. These groups will be given the task, some foundational scripture and reading material and a target of producing a two page summary document to MLT by YFC Conference in June '06 for compilation into a booklet. The benefits will include: demonstrating our commitment to Biblical theology as a basis for our praxis; further understanding of our values; building relationship across geographical and ministry lines within YFC and getting a broad group inputting.</p>
<p><strong>GAP YEAR / INTERNSHIP</strong></p>
<p>This is happening at the beginning of 2006 for anyone interested in giving a year to YFC.  The plan is that there will be a three month intensive together then the rest of the year will be based with a team of members around NZ.  It will be ideal for school leavers or those wanting a break from their jobs or Uni.  Contact Darryl for more information. <a href="mailto:d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a></p>
<p><strong>PROJECT SERVE</strong></p>
<p>We are making a final decision on the Project Serve Trip to Myanmar in December.  We need another 3 – 5 to make the trip viable. If you are interested in going let Darryl know ASAP please. <a href="mailto:d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a>   Also, Scottie in Northland is putting together a trip to Fiji in early December.  Contact him on <a href="mailto:s.slykerman@yfc.org.nz">s.slykerman@yfc.org.nz</a></p>
<p><strong>BOARD AND MLT</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that the Board and MLT are truly representative of the work and is a place for younger members to grow and function.  We are looking at this currently and will present an update to the Gathering (which is also the AGM for all the members of YFC.  We no longer have National Council)</p>
<p><strong>MUST READ</strong></p>
<p>Go to this link <a href="http://www.parkerfoundation.org/PDFs/SpiritualityOfFundraising.pdf">http://www.parkerfoundation.org/PDFs/SpiritualityOfFundraising.pdf</a> and download a copy of Henri Nouwen's booklet "The Spirituality of Fund-Raising".  We want all members to read this.  I read it and decided I would never talk about the problems of fund-raising again!!!  It's exciting and inspiring.</p>
<p>There is a lot more that is going on around NZ and it is a privilege to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Let us know of any news or views that you have</p>
<p>God Bless</p>
