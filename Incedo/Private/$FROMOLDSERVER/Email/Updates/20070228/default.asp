  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">    This a &quot;full&quot; update with a lot in it - this is because we are moving on - excellent stuff! </p>
  <p><strong>Reading<br>
  </strong>Reading for March is 1st, 2nd and 3rd John. (The epistles not the Gospel)</p>
  <p><strong>Membership, Ethos etc<br>
  </strong>We have just finished the second of our Ethos weekends in Timaru. They were great and thanks for making them so positive. For those who did not attend and therefore will no longer be members after the Gathering we say thank you for your membership to date. For those current members that did attend an Ethos we will see you at Surge and shortly after that let everyone know who the membership will be from the Gathering.</p>
  <p>Those that attended the Ethos weekends will  have received the paper  that will be the process for future membership. Please make sure you are aware of it, (you can download it <a href="membership.pdf">here</a>) and contact Karl (who wrote it) (<a href="mailto:k.dickson@yfc.org.nz">k.dickson@yfc.org.nz</a>) or any other member of the MLT if unclear. It is important that we are all able to answer queries on the process.</p>
  <p><strong>3x3x3 daily prayer<br>
  </strong>At the Ethos weekends we also adopted the new 3 minute daily prayer practice. See below for more information.  We will start as members at 12.15 on the 3rd March. The weekly prayer update is good fuel for this! We will be sendng the text to ||mobile|| for you. Please let Greg (<a href="mailto:g.tichbon@yfc.org.nz">g.tichbon@yfc.org.nz</a>) know if you would like to change this.</p>
  <p><strong>Name change<br>
  </strong>At the Board meeting held on the Sunday of the North Island Ethos a new name was adopted for YFCNZ. We will be known as Incedo. Download more information <a href="incedo.pdf">here</a>. We must make sure we are re birthing not re branding. This is signifying we are new and different not just the old repackaged.</p>
  <p><strong>Surge<br>
  </strong>You should have your planning all ready for this. Its shaping up really well and Scott and co are doing an excellent job of sorting it all out locally. Please respond to requests for information they make. A sign of Incedo is that we honour each other by responding quickly!</p>
  <p><strong>Texting</strong><br>
    We now have shortcode texting available. Simply if someone texts &quot;INZ&quot; followed by a predetermined word or message to 3320 we can capture the word or message as well as the sender's mobile number and reply to them with an appropriate response. Y-One  will be using this but it is available for the whole YFC/Incedo community. We are paying a fee for this service no matter how much we utilise it. The sender pays 20c te send the text. Contact Greg (<a href="mailto:g.tichbon@yfc.org.nz">g.tichbon@yfc.org.nz</a>) if you'd like more information or wish to utilise this. </p>
  <p>    <strong>X3Watch</strong><br>
    We have  agreed that all YFC computers will have the program; x3Watch installed by the end of February. Go to <a href="http://www.x3watch.com">www.x3watch.com</a> and follow the instructions. The accountability people are Sue Gardiner (<a href="mailto:s.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">s.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a>), Marg Row (<a href="mailto:m.row@hotmail.com">m.row@hotmail.com</a>), Judith Crump (<a href="mailto:thecrumps@xtra.co.nz">thecrumps@xtra.co.nz</a>). You can choose one. Any questions to Mal (<a href="mailto:m.green@yfc.org.nz">m.green@yfc.org.nz</a>)</p>

          <p><font color="#000099">We send a text, daily, to all members of YFC/Incedo, at between 12:00 and 12:30pm each day (rationale being that this will be a time when most people are on a break). </font></p>

                  <li><font color="#000099">One thing in the mission (May be our choice, may be a specific request).</font></li>
            </ul>            <p><font color="#000086">We start with Praise to God and your kingdom come, your will be done.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000099">3. Three verses to read - from the Book that is the reading for the month. <br>
  (Note: These may be read at the time or referred to later depending on circumstances of each individual at the time).</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000099">Key things; we are bedding in a discipline; we are all doing it together at the same time.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000099">We call it 3x3x3.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000099">We will start 3/3/07 and run for three months (till the gathering) and then evaluate it. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000099"> To send out to all members will cost (on current numbers) around $2,000 per year. Each Text to an individual will cost 12c per day (including GST) which equates to $43.80 per year.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000099">We are inviting members to make a voluntary donation of $40.00 per year to cover the costs. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000099">Glen Bennett will manage it along with the Prayer update. Mike Wood will select the bible verses for each day. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000099">We may expand to include associates and helpers at a later date.</font></p></td>
