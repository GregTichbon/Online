  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>The July weekend is coming up fast, and the deadline (June 14) has passed for getting back to Hannah on your attendance. Thank you to those who have replied quickly, and before the deadline, but the reality is that 50% of members have not replied.</p>
  <p> We are disappointed in this, and see it as a lack of respect for another member. We expected more from people who have committed to Incedo. </p>
  <p> In signing the membership form, members know that there was an expectation that you would attend two of the three weekends. The weekend in July is the second one that some people are missing... this calls into question commitment to membership. </p>
  <p> We appreciate your contributions; although it is important that we respect others requests for information promptly.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Regards, <br>
        Melody, Hannah and Karl<br>
