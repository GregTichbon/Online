  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">It is less than 7 weeks until SURGEten. The projects are all coming together really well. I am getting quite excited about it all!!</p>
  <p align="left">Shortly you will be receiving all the information in flier form that you can email and give out to specific young people you have been journeying with. Also there may be key friends of yours linked with what you do that you have been talking to about SURGEten that you hope will come.</p>
  <p align="left">PLEASE don't just ask anybody - give it sincere consideration as to the fellow journeyers that may benefit from joining us in this unique time together.</p>
  <p align="left">As I said in the Forum, we would like a level of maturity with the young people that come - ideally 15+. It is really about being able to work as a team without constant need for supervision. But we of course trust you in that decision!!</p>
  <p align="left">We are staying at TATUM PARK, State Highway 1 (7km south of Levin, 8km north of Otaki) <a href="http://www.tatumpark.co.nz">www.tatumpark.co.nz</a></p>
  <p align="left">Accomodation is varied - mostly in a very nice Lodge with single rooms, twin rooms, and queen rooms. There are also cabin/units for some families. (bringing your own bedding)</p>
  <p align="left">The cost will be subisidised at $55 per person over 14. Families will be $130 (with kids under 5 free). We do not want costs to be a hindrance.</p>
  <p align="left">It is a great family location with large grass areas, sports equipment and good big rooms to play during the day. We would love to encourage our Incedo families to come.</p>
  <p align="left">Our focus are 3 fold - which will be reflected in not only our projects but in all aspects from our meals to our recreation!!!</p>
  <p align="left">1. Enviromental - planting of native reserves and bird sanctuary, reclaiming native areas from noxious weeds 
    living simply - eating good local produce where possible.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Honouring tangata whenua - Personal projects for christian kaumatua who have served us over the years - both at their home and marae.</p>
  <p align="left"> 3. Whakawhanaungatanga (relating, building on those relationships) - hanging together, talking, working, laughing, supporting and sharing in the tasks..getting to know each other further.</p>
  <p align="left">There will be further updates soon!</p>
  <p align="left">Any questions please contact either myself or one of the SURGEten team below. Looking forward to seeing you there!!</p>
