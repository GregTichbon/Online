		    OH THE PLACES YOU'LL GO</strong><br>

			<p align="left">OH the places you'll go! When I watched this video I was blown away by the creativity, crazy community and challenge from the writing of Dr Seuss. The challenge to go down Streets that aren't marked, to go to places where others haven't been, how these places may be dark and unfamiliar and the challenge of those who are just waiting, waiting, waiting! </p>
			<p align="left">What about you? Are you just waiting, or are you prepared to come on this Faith Adventure, going to a place where the Streets are not marked, how much can you lose? How much can you gain?</p>
			<p align="left">This story seems to be a reflection of Incedo ... or what Incedo should be endeavouring to reflect. Going places that others don't, risking failure, not just waiting for the next best thing to happen, but going on, though the weather be foul. On you will go ... though your enemies prowl.</p>
			<p align="center">This is what God says, <br>
			  the God who builds a road right through the ocean,<br>
			  who carves a path through pounding waves, The God who summons horses and chariots and armies&mdash;<br>
			  they lie down and then can't get up; they're snuffed out like so many candles: &quot;Forget about what's happened;<br>
			  don't keep going over old history.<br>
			  Be alert, be present. <br>
			  I'm about to do something brand-new.<br>
			  It's bursting out! <br>
			  Don't you see it? <br>
			  There it is! <br>
			  I'm making a road through the desert, rivers in the badlands. Wild animals will say 'Thank you!' &mdash;the coyotes and the buzzards&mdash;Because I provided water in the desert, rivers through the sun-baked earth, Drinking water for the people I chose, the people I made especially for myself, a people custom-made to praise me.</p>

			<p align="left"><strong>MLT GET AWAY</strong><br>
		    During February, we met in Taranaki to reflect on Incedo's Mission and what we believe God is challenging us about. At the end of the 3 days we came away with the following 5 themes:</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p align="left"><strong>Values</strong><br>
		        We need to focus on developing membership understanding of Incedo&rsquo;s values, seeing how they underpin everything we are and do. Significance and integrity come from our rhythms practiced and worked out of our values.</p>
			  <p align="left"> <strong>Leaning in</strong><br>
      A hallmark of Incedo. Members lean into challenging, messy conversations and issues. Members lean out from unimportant, meaningless conversations and issues.</p>
			  <p align="left"> <strong>Monastic order</strong><br>
			    Incedo&rsquo;s sacred values and practices. This is Incedo&rsquo;s identity - we shouldn&rsquo;t fear this but own it, discovering the richness of our Monastic Order and where we fit in the World.</p>
			  <p align="left"> <strong>Fringe</strong><br>
			    Incedo is a Community of people reflecting our value: Priesthood of all Believers, who openly welcome others on the Fringe to join our Faith adventure.</p>
			  <p align="left"> <strong>Amore</strong><br>
      We are called to be AMATEURS because ... The Amore of Christ compels us.<br>
      2 Corinthians 5:14. The original meaning of being an Amateur was from the Latin word Amore - to Love ... when we do something as an Amateur we do it for the Love of it. God is looking for 'Amateurs' to Love and Serve in this World and ... Christ's Love has the first and last word in everything we do.</p>
			  <p align="left"> Underpinning the above themes is Incedo's commitment to MISSION. Incedo is an outward focused Monastic Order.</p>
			  <p align="left"> <strong>EPHESIANS 2:11-22 (The Message)</strong><br>
	          </p>
		  </blockquote>			<p align="left"><strong>VALUES FOCUS</strong><br>
		    Following on from the above themes that the MLT have identified, we would ask that members take time to reflect and contemplate Incedo's 6 values. How they impact/serve us in all we do and who we are. </p>
			<p align="left">Each month starting in April, members will be sent a pack with readings, clips and music that will focus on Incedo's values. This will be a different value over the next 6 months, leading up to Incedo's Discernment weekend: 28 September &ndash; 1 October.<br>
		  </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>LENTEN SKYPE REFLECTIONS</strong><br>
			  Every Thursday night, at 9.30pm leading up to Easter. Log onto Skype and look for incedo.connect If you'd like a turn at hosting one, please let Glen know.<br>
		  </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>THE GATHERING 2012</strong><br>
			  Friday 29 June beginning: 7pm till lunchtime Tuesday 3rd July. Location: The MERC, Torbay, Auckland www.merc.org.nz Cost: $200 per adult, $50 per child. While Incedo is subsidising the Gathering&rsquo;s costs we have included an element of travel in this costing and ask that those who'll be flying book their flights now so as to get the cheapest possible prices. This will mean that some people will get money back due to the travel equilibrium. Remember if cost is ever an issue to please contact the MLT to talk it over.</p>
			<p align="left">The Gathering is a Requirement for all Members to attend. We also hope that you will want to be there for the great relationships and engaging conversations. The Gathering is also a time to bring others into our Community, no strings attached. So take time now to ask those in your circles that you think would benefit from experiencing the Gathering. This isn't recruitment, rather connections and conversations.</p>
			<p align="left">As we need to finalise the number of people attending the Gathering: both adults and children by 1st June, please email Tracy your information asap and before 14th May.<br>
		  </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>FOCUS GROUPS</strong><br>
			  Currently we have 4 focus groups getting up and running. The Focus Groups are: Homosexuality; Young people as our Focus; Incedo Membership/connection and Incedo Service projects. If you haven't already engaged in one of these group&rsquo;s, then please let Glen know.<br>
		  </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>WEEKLY PRAYER UPDATE&rsquo;S AND DAILY PRAYER TEXTS</strong><br>
			  A big THANK YOU to everyone who has been involved with co-ordinating our weekly prayer updates and daily texts. It's great receiving these updates every day/week and we really appreciate all the effort and personal touches expressed.</p>
			<p align="left">If you would like to co-ordinate our Prayer updates and texts for a month, Tracy would love to hear from you.<br>
		  </p>
			<p align="left">As the first members update of 2012 comes to an end, we want to say a huge thank you to Dan and Horse in Tauranga for their unwavering commitment to serving young people through BMX Inc. They've run the club for 10 years and we thank them for their service and vision. If you haven't seen it already here's a video of the BMX Inc celebration weekend back in January, put together by a Tauranga City Councillor.</p>

			<p align="left">If you want to talk further about anything in this update or just want to chew the fat, share your ideas and dreams, then please contact us. We'd love to talk more about what God is doing within Incedo, where the MLT believes we're heading or just to catch up for a good old fashioned phone call.</p>
