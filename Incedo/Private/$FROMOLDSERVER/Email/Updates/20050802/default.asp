<p>Hello fellow Youth for Christ members
 

<p>Firstly just letting you know the Gospel for August is Matthew.  

 

<p>This weekend is Converge in the South Island, Paul, Sarah and Julie are putting it together so it should be a good time for us all that attend.  If you are unsure of details contact Darryl or John on <a href="mailto:j.brooks@yfc.org.nz">j.brooks@yfc.org.nz</a>   If finances are a problem just let us know.

 

<p>We are having another Project serve trip to Myanmar later this year to work with the YFC orphanage there.  If you are interested contact Darryl <a href="mailto:j.brooks@yfc.org.nz">d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a> for more information.  The dates are still to be decided but it will be around the end of November. 

 

<p>We have really turned a corner in this move and it's encouraging to see a number of conversations about the future and initiatives happening.  One of the conversations is the role of CTC and Summer Harvest based on our values.  Dave Treeby and Tracy are initiating these with a wide range and number of members. We are also in contact with the makers of Quest.  Phil Cann and Darryl spent some time together at the YFC International meeting last month.  They are coming up with a new series called ‘Deep Shorts’  The idea is that each is only 15 mins long and can stand alone so they can be used in lunchtimes etc.  (We have a draft version so if you want to see a copy let Darryl know and I'll send you a copy).  They are asking us to provide some interviews with Kiwi kids to include so we are looking at this at the moment.  We need to do better at reaching middle NZ young people and maybe this is one the keys we can use.  Connecting it with CTC and Harvests etc is one possibility.  As this is an ongoing discussion let us know if you have any thoughts…..all are welcome.

 

<p>By now you should also have been praying weekly for all your team….even better is that fact that they have been praying for you!  You should also be asking as a team how you represent Jesus in what you do…..give us some feedback on this.  

 

<p>We are also asking if you can let us know what non YFC community projects you are involved in this year.  Just email us and we will let everyone know to keep the ideas flowing.

 

<p>Finally lets be encouraged with the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:58 “So my dear brothers (and sisters) be strong and steady always abounding in the Lords work for you know nothing you do for the Lord is ever wasted as it would be if there were no resurrection”……good stuff aye!
