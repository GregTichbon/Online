  <p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>Just a quick members update to fill you all in on some happenings</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Bible reading for the month<br>
    </strong>The Bible reading for this month is Hebrews</p>
    <p><strong>CTC<br>
    </strong>CTC is coming up soon so make the most of it &hellip; it could be the last in its current format.</p>
    <p><strong>Search and Rescue<br>
    </strong>Sarah just finished her 8 day journey with a group of young people in the bush. One ran away which got Search and Rescue involved but it all ended up ok &hellip;. more of this type of stuff!</p>
    <p><strong>Project Serve in Whangarei<br>
    </strong>We will be having a Project Serve later this year painting the Northland YFC office. It will be good chance to get involved and while the project will probably take about 9 days there will be 2 weekends so volunteers can make it &hellip;. more details later.</p>
    <p><strong>Stations of the Cross<br>
    </strong>Stations of the Cross has finished in Hamilton. A number of members from other areas attended and we look to see how the creativity is expressed in other parts of NZ.</p>
    <p><strong>Sabbatical</strong><br>
        Mal and family are on sabbatical till August.</p>
    <p><strong>Daily Devotions<br>
    </strong>One idea for using the daily reflective devotionals (that all office based workers should be doing together daily) is to use a chapter of Hebrews (This months reading) for the meditation experience. In the Kapiti office I often do it alone and find it very worthwhile. </p>
    <p><strong>Korean camp<br>
    </strong>The Korean YFC conference held over the holidays in Auckland was huge success and is something to celebrate</p>

  <hr>  <p><em>P.S. The email below is from the Steiger school that has just finished in Waikanae www.steiger.org It is a very good example of creativity. We include it here as a thought starter.</em></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">For quite some time, I have felt the desire to reach out to people from the Gay and Lesbian community. Homosexual people in New Zealand see Christians as their enemies and unfortunately have often only received hate from them. This really saddens me because Jesus was a friend to sinners and always showed His love to them. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">Every Saturday at the Steiger Radical Missions and Leadership Training school is dedicated to evangelism. So when we heard that there was going to be a Gay and Lesbian Fair in Wellington (the capital of New Zealand) we decided we would go to the fair, and tell the people that Jesus loves them not because we condone their lifestyle, but because they have worth and Jesus died for them. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">I called Kate, the organizer of the fair, and told her that we were a Christian group and that we would like to serve at the fair in any way possible. Kate said that she had been looking for people to help pick up garbage and clean the toilets at the end of the day. I said that was perfect and that we would love to do that for her. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">I also asked her if we could serve water to the people at the fair, but she said that we would have to get a stall of our own to do that. So I went online and applied for a stall. I named our stall &quot;The Jesus Stall&quot; and made it very clear who we were and why we wanted to be there, but the organizers never got back to me and I was unsure of what to do. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">It was the night before the fair and we still hadn't heard back from them and so I decided that we would go down to the fair in faith and trust that Jesus would open the door for us. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">Early the next morning, a small group of us drove down to Wellington and arrived where the fair was being held. Only a few people were there and the organizer had not yet arrived. Even though we were not technically a part of the fair, I decided that it would be best if we claimed a spot for our stall. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">While some of our guys were setting up our stall, the organizers arrived and I went to talk to them. They hesitated when I told them who I was. Catherine, the person in charge, said angrily, &quot;You're the Christian group, aren't you? We decided that it would not be appropriate for you to be here. Why do you want to be here anyway?!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">I told them that we were there to serve them and that we just wanted to hand out water and pick up garbage at the end of the day. Catherine thought about it and then said that it was okay for us to be there, but if there were any problems we would have to leave immediately. I thanked her and told the others the good news. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">Because we got there so early, we were able to set up our stall right next to the stage where different gay and lesbian bands played all day. Our stall consisted of a small table covered with plastic cups of water. On each cup we wrote: &quot;Whoever drinks the water I give will never thirst &ndash; Jesus&quot;. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">The Lord blessed us with the hottest day we had had since the school started and soon we were handing out cups of water faster that we could pour them. People in our groups were constantly writing the verse on the cups and pouring water. Some people from our group were filling trays with cups of water and taking them around the fair and to the other stalls throughout the day. People at the fair called them the &quot;Jesus boys&quot; and gladly took the cups of water. By the end of the day, we handed out over 1200 cups of water! </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">It was such an amazingly simple concept, but it worked so well. We had many great conversations with people; we were even interviewed for a gay television show and had our picture taken for a gay magazine. One lady told us that the Jesus Stall was the most effective stall at the fair. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">At the end of the day we picked up garbage and cleaned the toilets. The organizers were so positive and thankful. Catherine told me that we had &quot;blessed&quot; them and that she was so glad that we had come. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#0000FF">As a result many gay and lesbian people were open to talking and thinking about Jesus for the first time!!! </font></p>
