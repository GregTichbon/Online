  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname|| </p>
  <p>Another update coming your way...!</p>
  <p>Firstly, a massive THANK YOU to John and Toni and team for the effort and heart they put into Surge. What a great weekend, in no small part thanks to the smooth running and organisation. You are stars!</p>
  <p>A reminder that our next get-together for members is at the Gathering, July 4-6. This will be hosted by Glen in New Plymouth. If you have any suggestions or thoughts on the content or tone of the Gathering, please let the MLT or Glen in on it, we'd love to know.</p>
  <p>You will have received an update outlining the tragic situation in Myanmar. Please pray for our friends there, and also in China with the recent earthquake. If you would like to send a donation, details of how you can do that are in the previous update. </p>
  <p>In other news, Julie has stepped down from the MLT at the last board meeting, and following is a bit about why...</p>
  <p><em>For some of you I realise this might have come out of the blue and I apologise if it comes as a shock! For me, it was simply the right time to step back from the MLT as this year in particular has been quite busy. There were a few reasons behind my thinking, ranging from feeling pressured and busy with my teaching through to feeling I wasn't spending the quality time with God that I wanted to in order to be a halfway decent leader of a spiritual community! </em></p>
  <p><em>I am staying as a member of Incedo, though, and am really looking forward to seeing what I can contribute as a member. Near the top of my list is time in prayer for Incedo, and hearing (hopefully) what the Lord has to say to us. I am also keen to organise a spiritual retreat in Hanmer - see you there! But mostly I will be happy to get a bit of headspace and see my life more in order.</em></p>
  <p>For now, leadership of the MLT rests with Karl and Paul, with Karl taking on the role of what used to be known as the 'national director'.</p>
  <p>Thanks heaps for your friendship and support over the past couple of years as we have worked together to see Incedo develop, long may it continue. See ya at the Gathering!<br>
  </p>
  <p>So that's all from us for now<br>
  </p>
  <p>God bless</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

      Karl, Paul and Julie<br>
