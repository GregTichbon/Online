Dear ||usefirstname||
<p>We just wanted to email you a quick note following on from the Gathering. It was a great time and thanks for making it go so well.</p>
<p>There are just three things to follow up.</p>
<p>1. As members we should all be beginning to apply the practices. They are all on the practice cards we handed out. (Let us know if you want another copy and we&rsquo;ll post one to you). We realise it will take some time for them to become regular &lsquo;rhythms&rsquo; of our life but we should all now be reading a gospel (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark;&version=51;">Mark</a> for this month) and praying weekly for our team mates as well as our ongoing regular involvement with young people. </p>
<p>It would be good to plan to have another two or three happening by the end of May such as meeting weekly with a prayer partner and thinking about who to meet with as a spiritual coach/mentor each term. Look outside of YFC folk for this. An elder, pastor, home group leader etc would be ideal.</p>
<p>When you have your next team meeting also begin to think how you can assist with a non YFC project this year. Two examples already happening are; From Hamilton helping with the clean up after a Council family event that coincides with Halloween and from Gisborne spending a half day cleaning up a beach (ask your council for potential locations). Make this a fun time where we get to show the wider community the servant aspect of being a Jesus follower.</p>
<p>Discipleship teas have been happening in some areas for a long time but for those where this is new why not try the idea of booking a caf&eacute; and sit round a table or tables asking yourselves some questions such as &ldquo;How have we clearly shown Jesus in our Rock Solid, atomic etc and have someone share for 10 minutes on the subject. If there are only a few of you that is ok. Numbers are not the key, attendance by members is. Make sure the evening is enjoyable. Potential YFC folk who attend should want to come because they pick up you want to be there. You could do the same from a home. These will build as we develop and grow.</p>
<p>2. North Island Training and South Island Training have been renamed 'Converge'. Converge for the North Island is on from the 29th April &ndash; 1 May. Go to the YFC website <a href="http://www.yfc.org.nz/private/registration">http://www.yfc.org.nz/private/registration</a> to find out details and to register. We realise it is following on very closely from the Gathering but for this year it has been unavoidable. Be assured it will not be a repeat but will follow on from the Gathering. Feel free to bring others that are interested in being a part of YFC. The emphasis is on spiritual formation rather than training. We are expecting all North island Members to attend. </p>
<p>South Island 'Converge' will be later in the year and John Brooks (<a href="mailto:j.brooks@yfc.org.nz">j.brooks@yfc.org.nz</a>) will let you know details.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.ctc.net.nz">CTC</a>. Many of you have had or are having Expressions. Remember to let Tracy (<a href="mailto:t.bedford@yfc.org.nz">t.bedford@yfc.org.nz</a>) or Dave (<a href="mailto:d.treeby@yfc.org.nz">d.treeby@yfc.org.nz</a>) know if you need help.   After CTC on the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday till lunch time we have YFCC (Youth for Christ Conference). Tony Campolo will be speaking to us on the Monday night and Tuesday morning and then we are having a time of refreshment for all members that attend. This will include such things as people coming in to pray for people, a session on looking after yourself and hopefully some Doctors, physiotherapists etc. The focus is on getting renewed and refreshed for the second half of the year. More on this later.</p>
<p>So be assured that you are a part of a bigger work that God is doing around the world. Take a minute and read <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20corinthians%2015:58&version1=51">1 Corinthians 15:58</a> (from the living Bible if possible).</p>
<p>Below are some FAQs relating to the practices you may find helpful. They will be on the YFC website as well.</p>
<p>God Bless</p>

<p>The most common asked FAQs re practises.</p>
<p>1. What does it mean to &lsquo;meet my prayer partner&rsquo; weekly? </p>
<p>This flows from our value of being Jesus Centred. It means you meet with someone each week to pray with. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=1%20thessalonians%205:17&version1=51">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>). It may be for 10 mins or longer. It is a time to pray for the other person and for them to pray for you. It may be in a lunch time, before or after a home group, or before or after church on Sunday. Whatever suits you best.</p>
<p>2. What does &lsquo;pray for each team member&rsquo; weekly mean? </p>
<p>Simply each person in your team gets prayed for by you each week, and you get prayed for by each member of your team also. It could be driving to work, before you go to sleep at night or during your quiet time. You may do it all at once or one person a day. It&rsquo;s up to you. This is something you do by yourself so you don&rsquo;t need to meet with them personally! It also flows from our value of being Jesus Centred. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:6;&version=51;">Matthew 6:6</a>) and our value of the Priesthood of all Believers (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=romans%2012:9-16&version1=51">Romans 12:9-16</a>)</p>
<p>3. What does &lsquo;read through an entire Gospel mean&rsquo;? </p>
<p>We believe that the word of God is vital for all Christians to have as a regular part of their life. We agree to read a Gospel each month which primarily focus on the teachings and life of Christ. This also ties in with our vale of being Jesus Centred and we will all be reading the same Gospel. You may choose to read a chapter a day or the whole book on the last day of the month. The key is that we are reading the words and life of Christ. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=matthew%207:24&version1=51">Matthew 7:24</a>)</p>
<p>4. What does &lsquo;meet with a spiritual coach&rsquo; mean? </p>
<p>We all need to have someone speaking into our lives and someone we can discuss anything with. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=proverbs%2019:20&version1=51">(Proverbs19:20</a>). This person is not meant to be a part of YFC and should be a bit more along the Christian journey than we are. You should meet them once a term for about an hour (but it could be more) and get their input into whatever you choose to bring up with them. This person could be a church leader, another mission leader or a retired missionary.</p>
<p>5. What is a &lsquo;discipleship tea&rsquo;? </p>
<p>This may be better described as a discipleship event. The idea is that members in an area meet together for activities that promote growing in Christ - prayer, devotion, worship, fun, encouragement. However we believe they are best done in the context of a meal. Could be breakfast, lunch, dinner or supper but don't skip the food! Jesus often discussed issues of life and faith with His disciples over a meal. In the YFC mission community the members meet together over a meal to explore a life issue (usually related to one of our values) and to reflect on the Gospel for the month. The discipleship tea should include a simple meal (members can pay $3.00 - $5.00) guided sharing (thoughts from the Gospel) Interactive study (on a life issue/value) prayer, stories (about what Jesus is doing in our mission projects, lives and young people). </p>
<p>6. What does it mean to &lsquo;as a team assist with a non YFC local community service project&rsquo;?</p>
<p>YFC members are all part of the communities that we live in and are a part of. One of the values we want to be known for is &ldquo;Mission Through Service&rdquo;. We want the community to see us as people that are not only there for ourselves and our own projects but to serve the communities we are a part of. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=philippians%202:3-4&version1=51">Philippians 2:3-4</a>). These projects might be helping with a school gala, talking to a council and cleaning up a park or beach or helping as volunteers with a local community fun day. It&rsquo;s only once a year but you can of course do more.</p>
