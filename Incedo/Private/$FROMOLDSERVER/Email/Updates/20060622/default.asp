  <p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>We should all be well into Marks Gospel if not the second time around it for the month. Ruth for next months reading will give a change from the New Testament.</p>
  <p><strong>Up coming dates:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>North Island Converge. 21st &ndash; 23rd July 2006. Lake Taupo Christian camp. South Island Converge. 28th &ndash; 30th July. Venue to be confirmed. <br>
      <br>
      Converge is compulsory for members and strongly recommended for Associates and helpers. As members our primary role will be to serve the others. We will focus on the value &lsquo;Priesthood of all believers&rsquo;. Make sure you plan for it now. The cost will be about $85.00pp and times etc will be as usual. Make sure you contact <a href="mailto:g.row@yfc.org.nz">Gus</a> (North Island) or <a href="mailto:p.keane@yfc.org.nz">Paul</a> (Mainland) if you have questions.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Senior Leadership Conference. (SLC) Whangarei. 24th &ndash; 26th November. This will be for the leadership teams from each base. We are tying it in with the Project serve painting the Whangarei offices. Some of us will be there early to do the work so why don&rsquo;t you consider this as well.</li>
    </ul>
	<p><strong>Name Change:</strong></p>
    <p>We have already decided that the trading name of YFCNZ will change. We will have the final name by SLC if not earlier. <a href="mailto:creativeteam@yfc.org.nz">The Creative team</a> and MLT are working on this and you should have got their email asking for ideas. There is also a discussion on the forums site (<a href="http://www.membersforum.org.nz">www.membersforum.org.nz</a>) for discussion. YFC will still exist as and when we need it but we will all be known in the main by the new name. We will let you know as soon as it is decided.</p>
  <p><strong>Orientation package:</strong></p>
  <p>Dave Tims, Dave Treeby and Rory Grant are heading up this for us all. It is aimed at replacing the old Introduction to Mission course with some sort of new YFC package. They will have a draft by SLC.</p>
  <p align="left">Members forum:</p>
  <p>Make sure you make the most of this. <a href="http://www.membersforum.org.nz">www.membersforum.org.nz</a> this is where most of the &lsquo;ideas&rsquo; and thinking that affects the decisions will be available. Thanks to those that are participating so far.</p>
  <p><strong>Wellington formation</strong></p>
  <p>Below is a paper written by Karl of the Wellington Kaitiaki (Leadership Team). Really good and thought provoking. Its all part of us &lsquo;being&rsquo; followers of Jesus.</p>
  <p>Finally we look forward to seeing you at Converge.</p>
  <p>God Bless</p>
  <p></p>

  <hr>  <p align="center"><strong>Wellington Kaitiaki (Leadership) Paper</strong></p>
  <p>YFCNZ in Wellington is starting on a three-month journey of, prayer, and reflection. This is not a step we take lightly, but it is a step that Kaitiaki feel God is calling us to take. As Kaitiaki, we must be obedient to the very strong call and presence of God we felt, as individuals and as a team, at out recent retreat.</p>
  <p>We are asking all those who are part of the community of YFC to join in this season; it is not something we can regulate, or enforce; but we will be providing opportunities for times where we can come together for worship, prayer, and ministry. We will shortly be circulating some information regarding the time frame for the three months, and also information on the &ldquo;where and when&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>The 6 &ldquo;areas&rdquo; of focus</p>
  <ul>
    <li> We are not praying for a specific topic, such as recruitment, or resources; but praying that God will reveal Himself anew, we would receive revelation through His word, and that the Holy Spirit would be present in a way never felt before.<br>
    </li>
    <li> We must pray that the new season YFC is heading into will be marked by God&rsquo;s presence in new and challenging ways, and that all that we do would be in His strength, His power, and His direction. <br>
    </li>
    <li> We want to be people who continue to walk in His steps, radiate His love, and glorify Him in all that we do. <br>
    </li>
    <li> We believe God wants to reveal any areas of sin or disobedience in YFC, and any &ldquo;blockages&rdquo; that will hinder us as we move forward. We pray that they would be brought into the light.<br>
    </li>
    <li> We are asking God to highlight anything that we need to repent of, either personally or publicly.<br>
    </li>
    <li> We want God to further strengthen, guide, and grow us, so that we can be people who are, first and foremost, followers of Jesus. </li>
  </ul>  
  <p>Scripture tells in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:18-22;&version=31;">Matthew 21:22</a> &ldquo;If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.&rdquo; This is a challenging verse for us, because if we are genuinely wanting God to answer us, then we must be prepared for the fact that when the Spirit of God moves we must act accordingly and faithfully. We must be prepared to be shaken; the cobwebs and dust blown away, and &ldquo;our cages rattled&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Whenever there is a move of God you can always expect opposition, so we need to prepare ourselves for this by standing firm on the assurance we have in Him, the promises He has given us, and the fact He &ldquo;will never leave us or forsake us&rdquo; as His children. </p>
  <p>Please feel free to copy this and distribute it to others who can join us as we embark on what will be an exciting, challenging, and God breathed season of prayer.</p>
