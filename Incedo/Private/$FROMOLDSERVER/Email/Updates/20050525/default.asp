<body>Dear ||usefirstname||
<p>The MLT are encouraged by the many new initiatives being taken by YFC missionaries all around the country.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One area with no office and one key volunteer had 28 entries at their first expressions and have 3 buses coming to CTC.<br>
  </li>
  <li>One area recently had 48 hours of prayer and used YFC as the prayer room. To quote the YFC missionary involved, &ldquo;It was so cool - fitting right in with the YFC aims of creativity and devotion etc. You know about the 24/7 prayer movement? It was part of that. We set the place up with candles and prayer stations etc and there were people in there the whole weekend. Amazing sense of God there and hundreds of people who came in and prayed. Now we will be opening yfc as the prayer room for the city every Friday night from 9pm-midnight. Experience from past 24/7 prayer centers has showed that over time (5-7 years?) it moves into a powerful mission experience with all sorts of people, especially young people, coming in off the streets to meet with God. Local people very excited about the prayer room, people were blown away by the times they had with God, and are very keen to continue to pray.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Another area has 3 volunteers personally renting a new space as a youth venue and to trial new ways of being church with non church young people.<br>
  </li>
  <li> There are 4 workers invited to run a weekly programme at a private school.<br>
  </li>
  <li> The discipleship teas have started up in a number of areas that have not regularly had them with new people often coming to see what the new YFC is all about. <br>
  </li>
  <li> Administratively we now have an accounting package that will be brought in around the various bases thereby relieving a lot of the accounts stress we face!<br>
  </li>
  <li> And we're constantly hearing positive feedback about base office devotions, and prayer for each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've got lots of hurdles still to overcome and it's not always going to be an easy ride, but God is doing good things and we should celebrate when He does.</p>
<p>With only two weeks to CTC lets make it the best ever by ensuring we spend time making every young person there feel they are special and taking the initiative where we can.</p>
<p>Keep the news coming, including the things that don&rsquo;t work&hellip;..it all part of who we are!</p>

<p>God bless</p>
