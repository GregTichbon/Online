  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">Tonight I was reading Maiah a story, and I noticed her wee feet. They are small, clean (ish), smooth, and soft; quite a contrast to mine, which currently have the remnants of my weekend rust and paint work from on a car on them. </p>
  <p align="left">My feet have skated, rafted, run, staggered, they have swum in oceans, and played on mountains, they walked me down the aisle with Mel, and they have stood in the presence of wise and foolish alike.</p>
  <p align="left"> Yet Maiah&rsquo;s feet have done very little, except walk, totter, run, and stamp in puddles. As a parent, I have no idea where her feet will lead her; where they will walk her, or if they will walk her down the aisle. Her tiny feet have yet to experience being nipped by a crab, they do not know the feeling of hot black sand, and they may never walk in places that I have walked. Yet I hope and pray that she walks the path God lays for her (in fact I hope she walks it better than I do), I hope and pray that she takes time to seek Yahweh's direction, I hope and pray that others will walk, run, skip, dance, and journey with her.</p>
  <p align="left"> It seems this year a few of us are thinking and praying about the next path/season/direction God has in store for us. Some of us are returning to study, some of us are doing what we did last year, and some are embarking on a new journey. So whether you are searching, or whether you are on the right path, even if you are not sure where your path is heading; I simply offer this Psalm  to my friends and fellow travelers:</p>
  <p align="center" class="style1"> Keep me safe, O God, <br>
      for in you I take refuge. </p>
  <p align="center"><em>I said to the LORD, &quot;You are my Lord; <br>
  apart from you I have no good thing.&quot; </em></p>
  <p align="center"><em> As for the saints who are in the land, <br>
  they are the glorious ones in whom is all my delight. </em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>The sorrows of those will increase <br>
    who run after other gods. <br>
    I will not pour out their libations of blood <br>
    or take up their names on my lips. </em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>LORD, you have assigned me my portion and my cup; <br>
    you have made my lot secure. </em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; <br>
    surely I have a delightful inheritance. </em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; <br>
    even at night my heart instructs me. </em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>I have set the LORD always before me. <br>
    Because he is at my right hand, <br>
    I will not be shaken. </em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; <br>
    my body also will rest secure, </em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>because you will not abandon me to the grave, <br>
    nor will you let your Holy One see decay. </em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>You have made known to me the path of life; <br>
    you will fill me with joy in your presence, <br>
    with eternal pleasures at your right hand.</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Shalom<br>
