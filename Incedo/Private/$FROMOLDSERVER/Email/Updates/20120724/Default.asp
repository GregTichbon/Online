			<p align="left" class="style1">Discernment Weekend</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Time</strong>: 8pm 28th September - 12noon 1st October</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Place</strong>: Wilkinson&rsquo;s Castle, North Taranaki</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Who</strong>: All current members wanting to continue their membership for the coming year, plus people wanting to explore membership with Incedo.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>What</strong>: The weekend will be a time of reflection, spiritual formation, being present with God and our peers. The time will focus on our individual/collective call and commitment to the mission of Incedo, sending us out to be present in our communities and wells we encounter. </p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Why</strong>: The discernment weekend has been introduced to create a sense of significance around Incedo membership. We want members to truly consider their commitment to membership over the coming year, sealing the deal with prayer and support from others in our community. We also want the weekend to be a time where people can step out of membership knowing that they&rsquo;re still part of the community and connected - membership is just one way to be part of our community.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>Coming soon</strong>: Prayer and preparation will be key to our time together. The MLT will be sending out preparation packs to inform you of what will be happening over the weekend, as well as focus areas for your personal preparation for the Discernment weekend.</p>
			<p align="left"><strong>RSVP</strong>: Please let us know by <span class="style2">Friday 3rd August</span> who will be attending the Discernment weekend. Children, adults, anyone you plan to bring who is considering membership or closer involvement with Incedo. <a href="mailto:mlt@incedo.org.nz">mlt@incedo.org.nz</a></p>

	      <p align="left" class="style1">Oh The Places You'll Go</p>
			<p align="left"> <img src="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20120724/places.jpg" width="287" height="272" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"> Back in March's members update, we talked about, &ldquo;The challenge to go down streets that aren't marked, to go to places where others haven't been, how these places may be dark and unfamiliar&rdquo;. We hope that you got a sense of Incedo moving down different streets at the Gathering. Gus and Marg sharing how different the gospel could look and challenging our evangelical 'givens'. Dialogue around being more open about sexuality, as well as leaning into the LGBTI conversation, even though we sit at different places on what we believe around this. Here's a quote that may be helpful:</p>
			<p align="left">&quot;When you see good people and godly people lined up on both sides of an issue, don't be so arrogant as to believe you are the one who will solve it&quot;.</p>
			<p align="left">Incedo continues to travel on roads and paths that move us further away from mainstream Christianity. As we lean into different conversation, topics and methods of mission, we will continue to move further away from the safety of what many of us have always known in Christianity. Are you prepared to come with us on this challenging and uncharted path? It may get messy out there, but as one member recently said, &ldquo;bring it on!&rdquo; Isaiah 43:16-21<br>
		  </p>
			<p align="left">Looking forward to hearing from you<br>
			  Glen, Tracy &amp; Dave<br>
