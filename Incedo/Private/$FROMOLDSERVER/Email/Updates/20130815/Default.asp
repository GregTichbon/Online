		<tr><td><p align="left">Greetings all and thanks for taking the time to read Incedo's latest members update.</p>
	        <p>Spread throughout this update is a four-fold Franciscan blessing to ponder as you read.</p>
	        <p><strong>Surge 13</strong><br>
          Thanks everyone for your open hearts and open minds during Surge with Idea Services Taranaki. Such good memories, great laughs, delicious food, cultural experiences, uncomfortable embraces, plus the overly excited personal space intrusions. </p>
	        <p>The feedback is in and Idea Services is a buzz with stories of what fun was had, their appreciation of Incedo's organisation of the weekend, and the true joy that the ka pai morning tea pack brought!</p>
	        <p>If you haven't already seen the official ball photos, here they are, browse and purchase at will.</p>

	        <p align="center"> Soooooooo! What about 2014? What about it ? well exactly! Surge&rsquo;s work fabulous when its work that is an extension of a relationship or passion already defined. Who's keen to get our wider Incedo whanau engaged in a people group in your community that you engage with? The MLT would LOVE to hear your ideas. So what about it ? Have a think. 2014 approaches...</p>
	        <p align="center" class="style1">May God bless you with a restless discomfort<br>
	          about easy answers, half-truths and superficial relationships,<br>
	          so that you may seek truth boldly and love deep within your heart.</p>
	        <p><strong>Sexuality focus group update</strong><br>
	          The Sexuality Focus (SFG) group has continued to be pro-active.<br>
              <br>
              We are aware there are implications for all members and Incedo's reputation if we pursue some of the options outlined below. So, we would like to request that all members prayerfully reflect, consider possible implications, and &lsquo;chew the fat&rsquo; with us during the Gathering. </p>
	        <p>Here&rsquo;s a summary:</p>
	        <p><em>A Different Conversation:</em><br>
	          Mal has been doing some fantastic ground-work on ADC. The first Auckland-based conversation with be during 18 &amp; 19 October. Invited &lsquo;voices&rsquo; include: Louisa Wall, Bruce Pilbrow, Peter Lineman and Mike Hercock. Mike will be a guest at The Gathering too!</p>
	        <p><em>Exotica:</em> <br>
	          This Auckland September Festival represents a Modern Day Well. One thought was for Pilgrim Coffee, to potentially provide a presence, but on enquiry they already have a coffee caravan. While we don't want to do something just for the sake of it, we do want to be challenged how we meaningful reflect our Values in the market-place. (this won't happen in 2013, but we're keen to consider taking up this opportunity in the future)</p>
	        <p><em>Non Hetro Marriage:</em><br>
	          We have asked Rachel O'Connor to share at the Gathering about why she plans to become a non hetro marriage celebrant. The sexuality focus group would like to request that Incedo allow/encourage our celebrants to offer non hetro marriage ceremonies. There will be an opportunity to discuss this option with Incedo celebrants during the Gathering. </p>
	        <p><em>Parachute:</em><br>
	          Greenbelt <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk">www.greenbelt.org.uk</a> is a Christian music festival in the UK. It's a very open event and has a large social justice bent to it. There is a group that participates and creates a space called OUTer Space <a href="http://www.outerspacelgbt.org.uk">www.outerspacelgbt.org.uk</a> Parachute is a very different festival, but maybe it's time we engaged the organisers and offered a similar space for festival goers.</p>
	        <p><em>Auckland Pride Festival</em>:<br>
	          This takes place in February 2014. <a href="http://www.aucklandpridefestival.org.nz">www.aucklandpridefestival.org.nz</a> The Big Gay Out and Pride Parade are part of the Festival. Anyone can offer events to the Festival and if accepted can be included in the official programme. Another Modern Day Well &hellip; Are there some ideas for opportunities of how we could serve at the Big Gay Out, or the Pride Parade, or what is an event we could run in conjunction with the Pride Festival?</p>
	        <p>Each of these opportunities present challenges for Incedo. They also represent opportunities to have meaningful engagement within our Communities, and have the potential to reflect our Values.</p>
	        <p>We welcome your feedback, thoughts and suggestions either: during the Gathering, or if you prefer contact Tracy, Dave or Glen to discuss prior to our time together at El Rancho during 27-30 September.</p>
	        <p align="center" class="style1">May God bless you with holy anger at injustice, oppression,<br>
	          and exploitation of people, so that you may tirelessly work for<br>
	          justice, freedom, and peace among all people.</p>
	        <p><strong>A Different Conversation</strong><br>

	          <br>
May God bless you with the gift of tears to shed with those who suffer from pain, rejection, starvation, or the loss of all that they cherish, <br>
	          so that you may reach out your hand to comfort them and transform their pain into joy.</p>
	        <p><strong>The Gathering 2013</strong><br>
          6 weeks till the Gathering in the sunny spring weather of Waikanae! We really would like you to think about a person, or people that you're connected with who'd benefit from spending a long weekend in Waikanae with some Incedo folks, listening and engaging in the <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20130815/IncedoStoryEmporium.pdf">Story Emporium</a>.</p>
	        <p> &hellip;.please circulate at will</p>
	        <p>Flick the MLT an email if you have someone you really would like Incedo to sponsor being there. It could be a significant neighbour, a youth leader you think could be challenged by doing the Jesus journey differently, maybe an acquaintance that open to exploring different stories, or even just your Mum who's always questions what antics you get up when doing the Incedo thing. </p>
	        <p>Seriously! Consider who you want at the Gathering and the MLT will consider sponsoring the full 100% of getting there, + + +.</p>
	        <p>The Gathering starts at 7pm on Friday 27th September and finishes at 2pm Monday 30th.<br>
	          $160 per adult, $50 per child.</p>
	        <p>Remember to start looking at items you could bring or buy for the gift table at the Gathering. This isn't the jumble sale table ... take some time and consider: maybe a great story book you own, or buy a copy of your favourite fiction or non-fiction book. What about bringing a gripping DVD, or a freshly purchased itunes album &hellip; and it's always intriguing knowing what and why people watch/listen/read what they do ... so your personal review could be good too.</p>
	        <p align="center" class="style1">May God bless you with enough foolishness to believe that<br>
	          you really CAN make a difference in this world, so that you are able, with God's grace, to do what others claim cannot be done.</p>
	        <p><strong>Incedo's Mission Giving</strong><br>
	          Historically Incedo Bases have contributed regularly to a mission fund that goes to support other mission groups locally and internationally. Thanks to South Auckland and Waikato for your contribution over the past year.</p>

	        <p align="center" class="style1">And the blessing of God the Supreme Majesty and our Creator,<br>
	          Jesus Christ the Incarnate Word who is our brother and Saviour,<br>
	          and the Holy Spirit, our Advocate and Guide, be with you<br>
	          and remain with you, this day and forevermore.</p>

	        <p><strong>To recap</strong><br>
	          The Gathering is coming, not Valentines day, but still think of somebody. Is more important than Valentines Day. Surge has been.Was good. Won't be back til next year. But think on that too. Lots of engagement... and maybe marriage with the homosexual community. Nice. And we gave $$ and Aroha. God be praised.</p>
