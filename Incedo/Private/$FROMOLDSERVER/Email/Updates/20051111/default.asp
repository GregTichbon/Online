Dear ||usefirstname||
<p>The Gospel for this month is <a href="http://www.yfc.org.nz/private/bible/book.asp?book=john">John</a>. We have heard from a few people that they are particularly enjoying the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%20;&version=65;">Message</a> version of the Gospels. Some are even reading it in two versions to see the differences and what they reveal.</p>
<p>For those on mission bases you will know that Wednesday is the day for praying for the rest of the mission nationwide. We received an email from Scott in Wanganui which is excellent and creative. It is at the bottom of this update.</p>
<p>YFCNZ is also actively involved in the Pacific development with Sereki (<a href="http://www.yfcfiji.org">Fiji</a>) and Isaia (Samoa). Some good news is that Bento has been with Sereki training for the past few years and is now planning to go home to Kiribati to start YFC and both Sereki and Isaia are visiting Vanuatu this month to plan a work there. It&rsquo;s all exciting particularly as it is being led by locals.</p>
<p>Planning for <a href="http://www.canvas.org.nz">Canvas</a>, Southern Harvest and <a href="http://www.summerharvest.co.nz">Summer Harvest</a> are all underway. Make sure you all have the information you need to be involved and to get kids involved. These opportunities are too good for young people too miss out on.</p>
<p>And finally&hellip;.be encouraged. We are getting there!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God Bless</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gus, Mal and Darryl<br>

<p><em>Scott in Wanganui </em></p>
<p><em>The fine weather inspired me to try something a bit different with our team today as we continued our weekly &quot;ritual&quot; of praying for the other YFC mission bases. We found it worthwhile, and thought others might benefit from giving it a go as well.</em></p>
<p><em>I printed a copy of the prayer list for everyone, and we went for a prayer walk. </em></p>
<p><em>We didn't know where we were going (symbolic of our change process as well!), and struggled at times to &quot;keep in step&quot; with each other, faced various distractions, and sometimes couldn't hear each other praying for all the noisy trucks, etc. that passed by. But still, we took turns, praying aloud as we walked. </em></p>
<p><em>When we finished, various team members noted the following:</em></p>
<ol>
  <li><em>The walk was symbolic of how we ought to be journeying together. Forward motion, allowing God to guide, etc.</em></li>
  <li><em> Learning to pray with distractions is probably a more valuable discipline than always trying to pray in an artificial environment without distractions. </em></li>
  <li><em> Being in the community was a reminder that we are (or ought to be) missional, not only on club night, but also as we pray. </em></li>
  <li><em> Not being able to hear one another was a reminder that the words we're praying are for God, not a human audience. </em></li>
  <li><em> Praying &quot;on the go&quot; is a reminder that prayer shouldn't be something we just do at designated times or in designated places, but always and everywhere. </em></li>
</ol>
