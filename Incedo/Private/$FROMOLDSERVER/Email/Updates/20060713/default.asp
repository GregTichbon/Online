  <p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>    The Bible book we all read for this month is Ruth. A wonderful story from the Old Testament that foretells the story of Christ. For August we will read Matthew and for September we will read James.<br>

    <strong>Project Serve</strong><br>
    <br>
    We will have to decide in the next week or so what trips are going ahead. While there is interest in all of them we need more to sign up. Please contact Gus on <a href="mailto:g.row@yfc.org.nz">g.row@yfc.org.nz</a> or 0212857025 for information.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Supporters nights</strong><br>
    <br>
    We are wanting each area to run a supporters night locally in either September, October or November this year. This is where we can clearly inform those who have been supporting YFC over the years what we are up to, the name change and why we are doing it all. Gus will be coming up with a draft of what the night should look like and at least 2 of the MLT will attend each one. We can talk more about this at Converge but can you look at a date that will suit and get back to Darryl please.
