  <p align="left">Hello friends!<br>
    <br>
    It is our hope that as many of you have enjoyed seeing the different flavours of what Incedo looks like in our communities throughout this year, you too will be encouraged and refreshed by your time with us in Whanganui the 19-21 of November. &quot;Community&quot; will be theme of our time together. This will be reflected through the time we share as an Incedo community through both formal and informal activities and also through the opportunities we will have to engage with the Whanganui community. We look forward to being able to take part in the Stone Soup gathering, being able to spend some time on the Whanganui River and share with you some of our favourite places here in our neck of the woods.<br>
    <br>
    We are welcoming those of you who plan to come to be here by mid-afternoon onward on the Friday. Friday evening will be pretty relaxed so feel free to come at your own leisure. We will finish Sunday after lunch. </p>
  <p>We need to know who is planning to come by 29 October as we will need to confirm our bookings. Please RSVP to Melody and let her know if your whanau will be coming along as well - they are most welcome!<br>
      <br>
      More specific details such as our accommodation and cost will be sent directly to those who let Melody know they are planning to come.<br>
      <br>
      Looking forward to having you here!</p>
  <p>Greg, Bryan, Rochelle, Britnee, Kylie and Melody</p>

  <p>RSVP to Melody at <a href="mailto:m.winters@incedo.org.nz">m.winters@incedo.org.nz</a>  </p>
