  <p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s now been 3 weeks since the Gathering and we want to thank you all for making it such a positive time. There is a renewed sense that we are moving forward and moving forward with each other and being led by the Holy Spirit. &hellip;what a great place to be!</p>
  <p><strong>Bible readings for the next four months</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>April is <strong><em>Philemon</em></strong> because it&rsquo;s short, and all about forgiveness.</li>
    <li>May is <em><strong>Hebrews</strong></em> because it&rsquo;s all about Jesus connection to the old Testament.</li>
    <li>June is <em><strong>Mark</strong></em>. The shortest gospel and probably the first one written.</li>
    <li>July is <em><strong>Ruth</strong></em> because its part of Jesus history</li>
  </ul>  <p><strong>Amnesty International week</strong></p>
  <p>It was agreed at the gathering that we all be involved in this campaign in a way that was appropriate for our area. Please email Gus (<a href="mailto:g.row@yfc.org.nz">g.row@yfc.org.nz</a>) with details of what you'll be doing ASAP and no later than May 12th. </p>
  <p>Date: Freedom week Aug 01-06 </p>
  <p><strong>Discussion forums</strong></p>
  <p>Tim from Otago has set up a forum site where we can discuss issues. There will be 4 &ndash; 5 articles pasted and a chance for us all to discuss them on site. We hope to change the articles each month or so. You should go to <a href="http://www.membersforum.org.nz">www.membersforum.org.nz</a> to log in. It is important that we use this facility to connect with each other and the issues we need to face. Expect at least one of the articles to be controversial and one to be information on the world of young people. This site is for members only and is a chance for us to look at some of the harder issues.</p>
  <p><strong>Member to member</strong></p>
  <p>Remember that we are now one nationwide movement. Take the initiative in connecting to other members. Don&rsquo;t check with the MLT&hellip;.just do it. The relationships will build amongst us when we all take our part of the responsibility seriously.</p>
  <p><strong>Finally</strong></p>
  <p>Thanks everyone. Keep using the prayer update to ask for prayer and to pray specifically.</p>
  <p> God Bless</p>
  <p></p>
