  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">You have received this email because we understand that you are not renewing your membership of Incedo/YFC from the next Gathering. Please excuse the format in which this is sent as it will be easier to read than any of our handwriting!</p>
  <p align="left">The time any of us spend in God&rsquo;s service is never wasted. (1 Corinthians 15:58) We want to acknowledge that you have left God's fingerprints on the lives you have connected with, and for that we thank you.</p>
  <p align="left">Having said that, this does not mean that you are now &quot;out&quot; of Incedo. Some have chosen to journey for a season as an associate, while others are exploring what their future connection could look like. Some have felt that it is time to end their season of involvement with us and we wish them well, and pray that God&rsquo;s hand will go with them as they seek His plans for them.</p>
  <p align="left">So no matter how you connect with Incedo from now on, the fact remains we are all people who are unified by God&rsquo;s Love, Peace, and Hope. We pray these would be with you as you walk in God&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>
