  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">With the Winter-season now upon us, we would like to treat you to a hot chocolate or cup of coffee, as you sit down, relax and read the following.</p>
  <p>  <strong>THE GATHERING</strong><br>
  The countdown is on for this year&rsquo;s Gathering, during 15-19 July in Palmerston North: <a href="http://www.highlandhome.co.nz">www.highlandhome.co.nz</a></p>
  <p>Soon you will be receiving information to help you prepare. As we did last year, we will be inviting some of the people who journey alongside us, to the Gathering. Do you know someone that needs to be there? The Gathering is a time for members, families &amp; volunteers/friends connected with Incedo to get together. We have an invitation letter if you&rsquo;d like a copy to send to someone.</p>
  <p>The cost of the Gathering is $140pp. (Special Family rate is $280.) Let someone from the MLT know if you have concerns about your travel and Gathering costs, but please let us know this by the 1st July.</p>
  <p>We would like regional team members to co-ordinate some activities during the Gathering. Your team activity should reflect: at least 2 Incedo values, be interactive and relevant for members, invited volunteers/friends and Incedo families - approx 35 adults and 15 children.<br>
      <br>
      Activity time length: approximately 30 minutes. Aim to meet as a team before 1st July to discuss and plan together. Writing pens, felt pens and a roll of newsprint will be available. Any other props: please bring with you.<br>
      <br>
      Regional teams:</p>
  <p>Daniel, Marg, Gus, Blair, and Laura (God-space on Saturday)<br>
      <br>
      Mark, Mal, Tim and Enice (God-space on Sunday)<br>
      <br>
      Glen, Jason and Greg (Introduction / crowd-breaker on 1st night - Friday)<br>
      <br>
      Mike, Karl, Sue and Darryl ('Fun' group activity on Saturday and Sunday)<br>
      <br>
      Botros, Michael, Hannah and Tracy (God-space on Monday)<br>
      <br>
      Alex and Sarah (Outdoor activities)<br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>MEMBERS HEALTH CHECK</strong><br>
    Glen and Tracy will be phoning each Incedo member sometime during the next few weeks. We would like to catch up with you all, not just to touch base, but also to go a little deeper. We&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts from the last MLT update around the WHY Incedo question. We&rsquo;re keen to hear how things really are, your hopes and dreams for the future. As well as how Incedo can serve you and how you can serve Incedo. We&rsquo;re looking forward to chatting with you all and are really keen for some honest reflections and thoughts from you.<br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>SPENDING OVER $1,000</strong><br>
    Please remember to touch base with the MLT if you are spending over $1,000 on any item. And a reminder: don&rsquo;t spend money you do not have or are not certain you will get. This includes signing agreements to purchase or hire without being certain you can fund them. As a nation-wide mission, we are all accountable to each other ... what you do, has an effect on all of us.<br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>SEATTLE/PORTLAND EXCURSION</strong><br>
    A small group of Incedo members were privileged to spend seven days in Seattle and Portland at the end of April, beginning of May. There were two conferences that were attended, Q IDEAS<a href="http://www.qideas.org/event/presentations.aspx"> www.qideas.org/event/presentations.aspx</a> and INHABIT <a href="http://www.inhabitconference.com">www.inhabitconference.com</a> We also spent time with Richard Twiss <a href="http://www.wiconi.com">www.wiconi.com</a> a Native American Indian who&rsquo;s challenged by his Faith, Culture and place in Christianity. Please contact Glen, Mal, Tracy, Gus or Laura if you&rsquo;d like to know more about our time away. Some of out learning&rsquo;s and ideas will be used and shared at this year&rsquo;s Gathering.<br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>WEEKLY PRAYER CONNECTION</strong><br>
    We would like to begin a weekly prayer inter-active connection for Incedo members. </p>
  <p>For this to happen, we need to know how many of us currently have access to SKYPE? Please let the MLT know if you do/don&rsquo;t have access. The prayer connection would run twice a week, 
    once in the morning (maybe Tuesday) and once in the evening, (maybe Thursday). 
    This would be an voluntary opportunity for members to be more effectively connected 
    regularly for prayer and reflection. We would like to begin this in the next two 
    weeks, so please get back to us asap.<br>
  </p>
  <p>BTW: The cup of coffee or hot chocolate mentioned 
    at the start of the update was actually a virtual cup ... 
    the real thing will be at the Gathering!</p>
  <p>Looking forward to being in touch soon.<br>
    </p>
