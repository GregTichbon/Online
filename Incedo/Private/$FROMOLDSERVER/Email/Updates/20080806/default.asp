  <p><strong><u>ROAD TRIP</u></strong><br>
    <br>

    I have planned to visit as many Incedo bases as possible before December, in my role as Board Chair. Where possible one of the MLT and possibly Bryan Feist, will be with me.<br>
    <br>
    I believe there are a number of important matters that will be more effectively worked through by a personal visit.<br>
    <br>
    I need to meet with office based workers, but would also be keen to have any other members involved. I have arranged for a whole day to be in most places, which will allow for me to meet with office-based workers during work hours, and volunteer members in either lunch time or after hours.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Please note.</strong> It is up to you to take initiative in your local area if you want to take advantage of the visit, to get up to speed.<br>
    <br>
    The goal is that we are all on the same page (and whatever other cliche you can think of), about some of the important things to do with Incedo.<br>
    <br>
    Here's a list of some of the items I'd like to cover:<br>
    <br>
    1. <strong>Shared experiences</strong> - So far 18 Incedo people have been involved in attending conferencews together, the major benefit being the team building aspect. I'd like to talk over options for more of these.<br>
    <br>
    2. <strong>Policies and Procedures </strong>- Some basic procedures relating to taking on FT or PT workers, Abuse reporting, Risk Managment, Computer Porn, etc.<br>
    <br>
    3. <strong>Accounts</strong> - maintaining accounts, fundraising, management of assets, funding new ventures, etc.<br>
    <br>
    4. <strong>Members/Helpers</strong> - some dialogue on how we handle the relationship between members, and the range of helperrs we have in Incedo.<br>
    <br>
    5. <strong>Communication</strong> - how we're going to increase the level of communication, nationwide. Including use of the website (will need to have an internet capable computer handy for this).<br>
    <br>
    6. <strong>Fostering Mission</strong> - how we begin to increase our engagment with non-christian young adults.<br>
    <br>
    7. <strong>Decisionmaking and implementation in the Mission</strong><br>
    <br>
    8. <strong>Key event ideas for 09</strong><br>
    <br>
