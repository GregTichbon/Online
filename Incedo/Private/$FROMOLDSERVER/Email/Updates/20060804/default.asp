  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">    Just a quick update to keep us all up to date.</p>
  <p align="left">The members Bible reading for August is Matthew and Septembers will be James. As Matthew has 28 chapters its basically 1 chapter a day if you start today!</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Supporters nights</strong></p>
  <p align="left">In the last update we said we will be running supporters nights locally in either September, October or November this year. This is where we can clearly inform those who have been supporting YFC over the years what we are up to, the name change and why we are doing it all. Gus is coming up with a draft of what the night should look like and at least 2 of the MLT will attend each one. To date we have only heard back with potential dates from Marlborough. Can you look at a date that will suit and get back to Darryl please this month. <a href="mailto:d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz">d.gardiner@yfc.org.nz</a> </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Converge</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Both North Island and South Island Converge have now finished. Thanks to all who were there and for the bogun and glam rockers that appeared on the Saturday nights!</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Project Serve</strong></p>
  <p align="left">At this stage we are looking at canceling Vladivostock and Myanmar as there are not enough people to make the team worthwhile. We will probably keep work on the marae in the Waikato for November but still need more people involved and we may have to cancel doing up the Whangarei offices if there is not more interest. If you are thinking about any of these please get back to Gus <a href="mailto:g.row@yfc.org.nz">g.row@yfc.org.nz</a> by next Wednesday or we will cancel.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Members&rsquo; forum</strong></p>
  <p align="left">It&rsquo;s good to see people logging in and commenting on some of the articles or the open forum. Remember this is where you get to have your say and comment on some of the issues and thinking that is affecting where we are going as a mission and its for members only.<a href="http://www.membersforum.org.nz"> www.membersforum.org.nz</a> </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Welcome back</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Mal is back from his sabbatical now and back involved as a member in Auckland.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Board meeting</strong></p>
  <p align="left">For your information the Board meet on August the 20th</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>New event ... still to be named but to replace CTC</strong></p>
  <p>The place will be Wanganui and the dates are the 19 - 22 April 2007. Put them in your diary now ... and mark Queens birthday as free!</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>And finally</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Sarah and Alex (Nelson) are getting married on 26th August great stuff!</p>
  <p align="left">Thanks for all you do</p>
  <p></p>
