  <p align="left">Spring-time Greetings.</p>
  <p align="left"> We are really looking forward to catching up during Surge and the opportunity to serve the Migrant Community in Hamilton during 7-10 October. </p>
  <p align="left"> Please remember to send your <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20110909/SurgeRegistration.doc">Surge registration</a> form to the Waikato crew asap and by Friday 30th September.</p>
  <p align="left"> We would like to feature an interactive, regional flavor to the Prayer Space at Surge. Please bring with you items that represent your place/space. (I will be bringing some river-stones from the Waimakariri.) </p>
  <p align="left"> Please download our <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20110909/MembershipForm.pdf">Membership Form and Incedo New Zealand Statement of Faith</a>.</p>
  <p align="left"> During the Gathering, we started a process of revising our Statement of Faith. So that we process well, we will update you regarding the next step that also will include discussing what it means to be an Incedo member in the future. </p>
  <p align="left"> If you would like to renew your Incedo membership, please print out and post a signed copy of your completed membership form to:</p>
  <p align="left"> The MLT, P.O. Box 89, NEW PLYMOUTH. We need to receive your form by Friday 25 September.</p>
  <p align="left"> This year, Incedo New Zealand AGM will be during Surge, on Sunday 9 October. As a member you need to be at the AGM. Glen will be sending information to you shortly in preparation.</p>
  <p align="left"> See you soon,</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
