		<tr><td><p align="left"><strong>Naked Spirituality Weekend</strong></p>
		    <p align="left"> Time to get anti-busy with a relaxed weekend of thinking and bringing your spiritual ideas and beliefs to the Communal table: Why? Because we care, we want to share 'nakedly' amongst ourselves; learning and gleaning from others without anyone being called an egg because they believe chickens hold the key to unraveling the book of Revelation. We think, therefore we are not lame. There will be no guest speakers or experts in the field ... it's &lsquo;in house&rsquo;. In anticipation of Brian McLaren's visit next year to the Incedo community, we are taking time out to share our beliefs/fears/scares/concrete and fragile notions of what it means to follow Jesus and honor God with our hearts and minds and live in the Kingdom. There will be space for challenge, negotiation and vulnerability with others as to the ideas in our heads. A time for a little mind renovation and reconstruction, demolition and additions ??? Who knows - but you&rsquo;re welcome to find out with the rest of us. </p>
		    <p>This is an optional weekend and funding is available to help get you there. Just let the MLT know your intentions for attending before the end of March. (<a href="mailto:mlt@incedo.org.nz">mlt@incedo.org.nz</a>)</p>
			<p>26 &ndash; 28 April, Silverstream Retreat, Wellington Region</p>
			<p>Book flights now &hellip;. you can get return flights from most locations for around $280 if you book asap!</p>
			<p><strong>Focus Groups</strong><br>
			  At Incedo we believe in being self-starters / pick me, to get the ball rolling / can we fix it - who knows &hellip; but I&rsquo;ll sure give it a go!</p>
			<p>So please let Glen   know what Focus Group you&rsquo;ve connected with this year, or the one you plan to connect with. (<a href="mailto:g.bennett@incedo.org.nz">g.bennett@incedo.org.nz</a>)</p>

			<p><strong>Gathering 2013</strong><br>
		    From 8pm, 27th September to 1pm, 30th September, in Waikanae. Please lock these dates into your diaries now. As signed up members you are expected to be at the Gathering and Surge. So we ask that you make it a priority to keep this time free for great Incedo community time.</p>
			<p>Story telling is going to be a big part of our Gathering this year. Do you know someone who&rsquo;s story might enrich our time together? It could be someone who&rsquo;s doing some really interesting stuff - someone who&rsquo;s totally stuffed it up - or maybe someone who doesn&rsquo;t even realise that they&rsquo;re doing stuff .......... contact Glen if you want to suggest anything or anyone. (<a href="mailto:g.bennett@incedo.org.nz">g.bennett@incedo.org.nz</a>)</p>
			<p><strong>Surge - Idea Services Taranaki</strong><br>
		      Our main Surge initiative this year will be connecting with Idea Services Taranaki (formerly IHC) Friday 19 July to Sunday 21 July.</p>
			<p>We&rsquo;ll be organising Idea Services Taranaki wide formal Ball on the Saturday night. Yes everything - catering - music - venue design - transport - photography ... We&rsquo;ll also get to spend time with clients, a bit of touch up work around the residential homes as well as doing low level improvements in some clients own homes. So there is plenty to do and heaps of variety.</p>
			<p>Plan to be in Taranaki: 7.30pm Friday 19 July till 4pm Sunday 21 July </p>

			<p><strong>YFCI</strong><br>
			  Two representatives of YFCI met with Tracy, Blair and Glen at the end of February. They were in New Zealand looking to see if there were the right people or environment to set up YFCNZ. If you&rsquo;re interested in this conversation please follow up with Tracy, she can fill you in (<a href="mailto:t.bedford@incedo.org.nz">t.bedford@incedo.org.nz)</a></p>
			<p>Incedo still holds the name Youth For Christ NZ. At some stage we will need to get the feeling of Incedo members about giving this name up. We will keep you in touch with future developments!</p>
			<p><strong>We Value Charity</strong><br>
			  At Incedo's last Board meeting, we approved the gifting of $5000 to Tuia. Check them out on Facebook (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/tuiatour2013">www.facebook.com/tuiatour2013</a>) read the attached document; <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20130308/Tuia%20Investment%20Opportunity%202013.pdf">Tuia</a></p>
			<p> We also gave a koha of $5000 (US) to Katherine Twiss whose husband, Richard Twiss died last month. Check out their mission organisation (<a href="http://www.wiconi.com/?cid=1276">www.wiconi.com/?cid=1276</a>)</p>
