<p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
<p>Just a month to the Gathering (31 March - 02 April)</p>
<p>  New location (Otaki, just out of Wellington), and for YFC, a key part of our new start. A chance to reflect but more importantly to look ahead and set in place the way we will become.</p>
<p> The Gathering is also the AGM of the new YFC. We'll be letting you know, in a couple of weeks, the people we believe should take key leadership in the next phase of our mission:</p>
<ul>
  <li> National Board</li>
  <li>Mission Leadership Team</li>
  <li>Back Room Think Tank</li>
  <li>Creative Team</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gathering will be the place to ratify these appointments, and to renew our comminment as members of the nationwide mission.</p>
<p>  It is important to remind you that it is compulsory for all members to fill out the form that was sent with the last update. We have included part of the last update below <font color="#990033">(in brown)</font> to remind you. If we do not receive it by the 10th March we will take it that you no longer want to be a member. If you are having trouble with it, let us know before then and we will help you. We are using the results not only to define membership but to get feedback on the practices as we will be making some changes at the Gathering based on this.</p>
<p>The formal part of the Gathering will start at 8pm on Friday. That means arriving well before that to settle in. It will conclude with lunch on Sunday. Please plan your travel accordingly. If you are flying in to Wellington, allow 60-90 minutes to get from the airport to the camp.</p>
<p>A few bits and pieces.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The weekly prayer update is happening each week. Please use it to pray specifically for other members around New Zealand and also to find out what is going on. And use it get prayer for your own work and people.</li>
  <li>Kev and Dianne from Wellington are resigning from the 31st March as director of Wellington. They will take a 6 month sabbatical as they discern the next mission stage of their lives. They are well into the process of setting Wellington up with a revised leadership team to help serve the mission there</li>
  <li>There is a Project Serve Team going to Myanmar in April. John Brooks is leading this.</li>
  <li>A new Rock Solid club is starting up in Waikanae on the 24th March.</li>
  <li>Sarah&rsquo;s school project in Nelson is now starting after initially being told &quot;no&quot; last year. It has a strong outdoors focus.</li>
  <li>Glen has a temporary co-worker in the boys home (PTL) in Marfell but we need someone more permanent.</li>
  <li>Y-One have begun, in fact, almost finished their training.</li>
  <li>Mal is starting a publishing project called &quot;My Voice&quot; using the stories of young people.</li>
  <li>The stations of the cross planning and set up in Hamilton is well under way and we recommend that, if possible, you get along to both experience it and get inspired as to what you could do next year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in touch and contact us at any time.</p>

<p><font color="#990033">1. <a href="20060303/MissionReview06.pdf">MissionReview06.pdf</a> is the review tool that we talked about in our last update to members that you received a few days ago. Please get on to this A.S.A.P. The whole process needs to be completed by 10 March. We think you will find it a useful exercise.</font></p>
<p><font color="#990033">Print off the review (3 pages) and it should take no more than 15 minutes to fill out - Mal has done it for himself and it took 10 minutes. The processing of it with a small group of members may take up to an hour. The completion of this is necessary for all members who wish to continue in membership of the YFC NZ Mission Community. Please send your completed form once you have met with some other members to review to us electronically to <a href="mailto:m.green@yfc.org.nz">m.green@yfc.org.nz</a> or by post to P O Box 34552, Birkenhead, Auckland by March 10.</font></p>
<p><font color="#990033">2. <a href="20060303/Associates.pdf">Associates.pdf</a> is an explanation of a new level of membership that SLC talked about and decided to proceed with.</font></p>
<p><font color="#990033">We look forward to receiving your responses and please let us know any questions or ways in which we can assist you with this.</font></p>
