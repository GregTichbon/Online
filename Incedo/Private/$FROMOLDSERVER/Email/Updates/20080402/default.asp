  <p align="center"><strong>REPORT ON TRIP TO NEW CONSPIRATORS CONFERENCE<br> 
    SEATTLE FEB 24 - MARCH 04</strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Background;</strong> 3 years ago Tom &amp; Christine Sine were a resource during YFC's change process. They organised the New Conspirators this year to bring together people from 4 different &quot;streams&quot; they had identified as impacting the Body of Christ:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> MISSIONAL - the focus on true mission in urban communities</li>
    <li> MOSAIC - perhaps better labelled as multi-ethnic faith communities</li>
    <li> MONASTIC - the growing interest amongst young adults, in new styles of religious community</li>
    <li> EMERGING - the new styles of church, particularly those utilising old traditions/liturgy with new issues.</li>
  </ul>  <p align="left"> <strong>Purpose for Incedo</strong><br>
          <br>
          The major benefits for Incedo attending seemed to be:</p>
  <p align="left"> 1. Connecting with other faith communities and individuals on similar journeys to ours, and asking similar questions - building contacts for the future.</p>
  <p align="left"> 2. Helping Incedo determine &quot;where we fit&quot; in the Body of Christ. We have gone from being a parachurch organisation, to a mission. But what does that mean?</p>
  <p align="left"> The original plan was for Gus, Glen, &amp; Julie to attend however Julies school responsibilities precluded her going.</p>
  <p align="left"> <strong>Positives</strong></p>
  <p align="left">1. Good contacts. Some of the organisations represented:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Missio Dei Community, Minneapolis</li>
    <li> The Simple Way, Philadelphia</li>
    <li> Emergent Village</li>
    <li> Re Imagine</li>
    <li> La Red del Camino</li>
    <li> Jesus Manifesto</li>
    <li> Mustard Seed Associates</li>
  </ul>  
  <p align="left">      2. Encouragement - God is definitely prompting people to ask the questions we have, and are, facing. In fact Incedo needs to take more of an international role (see suggestions below)</p>
  <p align="left"> 3. Inspiration - it was worth the trip to hear Efrem Smith preach! To see moonwalking used as worship! And to hear stories of old congregations giving away their entire plant ($7 million worth in one case) to younger groups.</p>
  <p align="left"> 4. Ideas - some good ideas for Gatherings and Converge.</p>
  <p align="left"> <strong>Negatives</strong></p>
  <p align="left">          Like all left-wing events it was high on ideas and inspiration, not so great on organisation. You can check out the conference at <a href="http://www.msainfo.org">www.msainfo.org</a></p>
  <p align="left"> <strong>Coincidentally</strong> There was another Seattle conference, Resurgence, earlier in the same week so we attended that as well. Organised by Mars Hill Church, whose pastor 
      Mark Driscoll was an early participant in the Emergent Movement, they have now taken a solid stand against many emergent leaders, labelling them false prophets. It was clear that Glen and I were the heretics in the audience of 1000. However there was helpful teaching on some issues and it was good to have our perspective of the whole emergent movement, challenged.</p>
  <p align="left"> <strong>SUGGESTION</strong></p>
  <p align="left">          One thing is obvious from contact with the emergent/missional/monastic movement : Incedo is at the forefront of much that is going on. The questions we have faced, and decisions made, are not only ground breaking for a 60yr old organisation, but cutting edge in terms of christian culture.</p>
  <p align="left"> Importantly, many of our newer initiatives are the equal of those anywhere. Some examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> the worship events we've used at Gatherings/Converge/Waikato Exile etc. are as innovative as anything going on around the world.</li>
    <li> our exploration of liturgical events for mission to youth, is also leading edge</li>
    <li> our approach to team leadership is amongst a few bold management initiatives. Not many other churches/organisations have gone beyond talk in this area.</li>
    <li> our focus on service, in mission with young people is innovative.</li>
  </ul>  
  <p align="left"> <strong>Why is this important?</strong> Because we suffer from a loss of confidence. The changes have reduced the size of our mission to possibly a third of what it was. Having found our past worth in size, we are still plagued with that mindset. Members, helpers and onlookers, all wonder and worry that we've made a mistake.</p>
  <p align="left"> <strong>We need to get momentum back into Incedo.</strong> Not for the sake of size but because our gospel mission must stay urgent. While we accept the downturn in activity due to a desire to refocus and &quot;get it right&quot;, the mission is still to lost young people. Surely it must keep us awake at night, that so many have yet to encounter the Christ we follow.</p>
  <p align="left"> I would argue stongly that a key part to our mission is involving more and more helpers in the adventure of living out our faith in mission. There is, and will be, a growing number of young adults looking for a mission like Incedo but we are largely off their radar.</p>
  <p align="left"> To get on it, we must get proactive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> get our people involved more and more in the wider fringe christian community. Speaking at Gatherings, leading worship, sharing ideas</li>
    <li> get our key people to events like the Johnny Baker meetings in Melbourne, to network and share. Speaking up. Contributing.</li>
    <li> get the web site running - focusing on the 18 plus age who are dissatisfied with status quo christianity. Include links to events like Stations of the Cross. Have sections on Project Serve activity. A whole section of our alt worship ideas. Things that demonstrate what we're about.</li>
    <li> get some of our key people blogging on behalf of Incedo. And linking to other bloggers....... e.g. Christine Sine now has the whole Stations of the Cross site, photos etc on her blog.</li>
  </ul>  <p align="left"> Frankly, the MLT, Tracey, Glen, Gus,Darryl, Mal, Dave - could have put on an even better New Conspirators Conference. Time to step up to the plate!</p>
  <p align="left"> <strong>Lastly $$$$</strong></p>
  <p align="left"> The cost involved airfares, conference registrations, care hire and food. Accommodation was free except for one night. The costs were shared by National, Taranaki and Gus's ministry a/c</p>
