        <p>Greg is  looking for some PA Equipment, especially a mixer, microphones and cables. Do you have any surplus equipment that you would like to sell.</p>
        <p>If so please contact <a href="mailto:g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz">Greg Tichbon</a> (027 2495088) </p>
        <hr align="left">
        <p>There are no longer PO Boxes for Southland or Dunedin. Please can you check any mailing lists and remove these.</p>
        <hr align="left">        <p>We once again have the ability to have people text to a shortcode. This is where a person can text a message to a 4 digit number, we can capture what they send us as well as their mobile number and then send a pre-determined response and take any other action we want.</p>
        <p>This could be used for polls, competitions, instant feedback, to respond with certain information, to alert by email or text message some others etc etc.</p>
        <p>Talk to <a href="mailto:g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz">Greg Tichbon</a> (027 2495088) if you have any ideas that you would like to implement.  </p>
        <hr align="left">        <p> MICROSOFT LICENSING - We are about to buy some Microsoft Licences. Charity pricing is good. eg: Office Pro 2007 is $135.00+GST. If you need any Microsoft licences please let <a href="mailto:g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz">Greg Tichbon</a> (027 2495088) know by Friday 7 August.</p>
        <hr align="left">        <p>We are getting some more letterhead printed. Obviously the more we get printed the better the cost per unit is. Please can you let <a href="mailto:g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz">Greg Tichbon</a> (027 2495088) know by Friday 7 August.</p>
        <hr align="left">        <p>We have completed our annual review for Incedo insurances. </p>
        <p>In August your base will receive an invoice for the portion of insurance in proportion to the number of staff, value of plant &amp; equipment, vehicles and use of Incedo buildings.</p>
        <p> This can be paid in one lump sum or spread over 10 months by automatic payment. Please factor these premiums into your Mission Base budget costs.</p>
        <p>This year we have been able to hold our premium costs similar to other years. </p>
        <p> The insurers have noted concern at the number of claims for vehicles and in particular for broken windscreens. </p>
        <p> To this effect we are able to make a saving of close to $3,000 by having a $150 excess on windscreen claims. </p>
        <p> This excess will be payable by the base concerned. </p>
        <p>We encourage you to take particular care of who drives the Incedo vehicles, and drivers must have a licence appropriate to the class of vehicle they drive.</p>
        <p>If you have the misfortune of having a claim, please email the claims section of Crombie Lockwood: <a href="mailto:eileen.foster@crombielockwood.co.nz">eileen.foster@crombielockwood.co.nz</a> Phone  06-3502139.  Fax: 06 3502140. <br>
