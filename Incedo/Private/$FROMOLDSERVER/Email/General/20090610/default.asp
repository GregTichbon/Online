      <td><p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname|| </p>
        <p align="left">This is a heads up on an event planned for November.<br>
          <br>
          As you're aware, the change from YFC to Incedo has largely been &quot;under the radar&quot;. We haven't made any public pronouncements or 'rebranding launches'. We believed the best approach was to quietly get on with changing, and let people find out by word of mouth.<br>
          <br>
          However, we think the time is right to be a little more bold about what we're doing.<br>
          <br>
          The plan is to hold a series of meetings in 6 -7 cities and towns over a 10-day period, around November. The meetings will feature a DVD presentation based on interviews with non-christians, ex-christians, and missional christians. The focus of the DVD will be a provocative challenge that Christianity nees to change, in order to engage more significantly with the Kiwi cultural landscape. The DVD will be followed by a guest speaker.<br>
          <br>
          Our goal is not to get the Christian community to like us, but to connect with those who share our concern for Christianity's increasing 'distance' from regular NZers.<br>
          <br>
          We hope the roadshow will get us noticed and lead to more people interested in our mission.<br>
          <br>
        More complete details will be outlined at the Gathering in September but for now:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> be aware of the event. As soon as we can confirm dates/locations we'll let you know. But inevitably there will be some disruption to your regular planning. If the only day we can get to, or near, your town, is a regular club night, we will expect you to prioritise the Roadshow.<br>
          </li>
          <li> Obviously we can't get to everyone, so some of you will have to travel and hopefully bring others with you. Our intention is to do a sequel in 2010, with new info and speaker. Places that missed in 09 will get priority in '10.</li>
        </ul>
