  <p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>I have been doing a lot of work on the internal Incedo website as a followup of the meetings we had at the Gathering and the general discussion about better communication.</p>
  <p>Most of the work I have undertaken is about functionality not aesthetics, I can work on this later when I know everything works as it should.</p>
  <p>What I need now is some rigorous testing and your comments. Please could you start using the pages at <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/private">www.incedo.org.nz/private</a>. Your ID is ||id|| and your password is ||password||.</p>
  <p>A suggestion is that you <strong>make this page your default home page</strong> so that when you start your internet browser you are kept upto date with the latest information. I am working on making it so that those things you have not yet viewed are hilighted and brought to your attention. </p>
  <p>The page has a menu on the left hand side. There is a security system built in which will allow different members different levels of access. Please play. A couple of things that I would like you to test in particular are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintaining your details and adding a profile under your details under People. You may also like to amend your photo :-) Please ensure your birthdate is correct as this is part of the membership register. (Check out Toni Brooks on the Member of the Day) </li>
    <li>Post some comments on the forum. Add a new topic if you have a burning item you'd like to discuss. There should be more about this in a following email. </li>
  </ul>  <p>Please don't maintain the connect|me and supporters databases yet, but feel free to have a play with them. </p>
  <p>Plans for the future:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A lot of tidy up; aesthetics and functionality!</li>
    <li>Adding Buy, sell, and exchange.</li>
    <li>Adding events. </li>
    <li>Maintaining the data for supporters and connect|me.</li>
    <li>General work on the Incedo public site.</li>
    <li>Making the Incedo public pages more interactive. </li>
    <li>A real-time, online support, councelling, information system.</li>
    <li>Finding people who will keep all information current and relevant. </li>
  </ul>  
  <p>It would be preferable if you could add your comments, suggestions and bugs found to the appropriate forum but feel free to contect me:</p>
