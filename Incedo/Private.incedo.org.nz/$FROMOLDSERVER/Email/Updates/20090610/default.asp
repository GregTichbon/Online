  <p align="left">Shalom ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left"> Warning- It&rsquo;s a long one.</p>
  <p>You yourself have done this plenty of times, spoken words <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that clarify, encouraged those who were about to quit.<br>
  Your words have put stumbling people on their feet, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;put fresh hope in people about to collapse.<br>
  But now you're the one in trouble&mdash;you're hurting! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;You've been hit hard and you're reeling from the blow.<br>
  But shouldn't your devout life give you confidence now? <br>
  Shouldn't your exemplary life give you hope?<br>

  <p>It&rsquo;s cold. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s cold and I am tired. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s cold, I am tired, and I am frustrated.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I always find this time of the year the hardest. I love winter (rain, southerlies, the lot); but this is the time of the year when I sometimes find it hard to get excited/motivated/enthused about mission. Winter can be just as spiritually, or as emotionally cold as Lambton Quay can be physically cold in the middle of July. </p>
  <p>So on this cold winters day I am sitting in our local Westfield Mall, which is obviously quite a contrast to the High School staff room that I sit in between seeing students. Here there is life, noise; in fact just within earshot there is laughter from a group of workmates, and tears from small children being removed from the play area. There are window shoppers, serious shoppers, students who should be in school, old couples holding hands and young couples wanting to. </p>
  <p>We are all drawn to this mall by different motives, but we are all here. But that is where the connection finishes. There is no relationship, other than we are sharing the same mall. Sure we walk in the same direction, stare blankly at one another on the escalator; eat in the same food court- but that does not make relationship. It just makes a mall full of people consuming, and pursuing their own agendas.</p>
  <p>Tragically (although I am not surprised) some churches often feel like this- all singing the same songs, all in the same room together at the same time, all consuming. We stare blankly at the &ldquo;window displays&rdquo;, the well-dressed mannequins up the front, and we sit and we consume. </p>
  <p>Churches become like malls, and Malls strive to become our churches.</p>
  <p>In the midst of all this confusion and thinking on this Tuesday morning, I thank God that Incedo feels different. Why does it feel different? What is that difference?</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s a simple answer really- you and me.<br>
    The great strength of Incedo is us; without us the values of Incedo are just ink on paper or pixels on a screen.</p>
  <p>Over Queens Birthday weekend in the mighty Taranaki and on the beautiful East Coast, people gathered. In Gisborne a week earlier people gathered. At these places (just to name three) some worked, some hung out, some served, some stayed up late, some saw movies, some spoke on the paepae, and some went home tired. Even though what people did at these three places was diverse, we all gathered as friends. </p>
  <p>So as I sit here tired, grumpy, and not very enthused, I reflect on those words I read this morning from Job. But I do not think of my words, as much as I think of your words that I have heard, your emails or your Facebook comments I have read. I think of the people those words have come from, I remember the laughter (and the tears), I think about my friends.</p>
  <p>I know that even though I sit in a crowded mall, surrounded by strangers, shoppers, and small children- I do not sit here alone. You do not sit alone, where you are, even if you are by yourself. </p>
  <p>We are becoming more than just co-conspirators, more than just people who share the same values, I believe we are becoming people who are discovering friendships, I believe we are discovering what it takes to be a nationwide community. In short, I believe we are discovering Aroha. While this may sound cheesy, or &ldquo;over the top&rdquo;; this will be what defines us in the years to come. This is what will draw people to us, and this is what will sustain in the &ldquo;winter seasons&rdquo; of our journey. </p>
  <p><em>Your words have put stumbling people on their feet, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;put fresh hope in people about to collapse.</em></p>
  <p>They did what? Where are they going? Who?</p>
  <p>Mark Campbell and long time volunteer Dave Roberts are off to Vladivostok from 26 June until July10. They are playing a large role in a camp for young people who come from the streets of Vladivostok, and will no doubt add their own unique flavour to the program. A good way to play a part in this with them is to sponsor the cost of the camp for one young person. These are young people who are amongst some of the most forgotten in the world, but for a few bucks we can help them have a great time with those who have chosen to serve them and remember them daily. Contact Mark <a href="mailto:m.campbell@incedo.org.nz">m.campbell@incedo.org.nz</a> for more info.</p>
  <p>Stu Barris has been involved with the crew from the Waikato for many years. Some of us know him well, and some of us don&rsquo;t. Stu as just moved to Te Araroa on the East Cape where there has been a great relationship between Waikato Incedo and the community for many years. We pray that Gods hand would be with Stu as he starts the next season of his journey, and we pray that God will continue to direct his path.</p>
  <p>Melody, Karl, Sarah and Alex are heading off the Aspire conference in Fiji being run by Fiji YFC and YFC Asia Pacific. They head off on June 23 and return on the 28th. They will be spending time with people from Fiji, OZ, Samoa, Tonga, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. It will be a great opportunity to discover how we can best serve the lead Fiji YFC is taking in wanting to spread the message of mission to some of the smaller countries in the Pacific. Karl will also spending time discussing the way forward for Incedo as a part of YCI with Scott Cougill who is the Asia Pacific Director, and a member of the YFCI World Leadership Team. </p>
  <p>Preston and LeeAnne left on June 5 to head back to the USA, to prepare for the birth of their wee one. They added their own unique flavour to our community, and made an impact on the lives of the young people they spent time with in Northland. They truly loved their time in NZ, they felt a part of Incedo, and have made genuine good friendships with people over here. We look froward to celebrating the birth of their little souvenir from Northland. </p>
  <p>Surge 10 will be held in the lower part of the North Island, most likely being the Welly/Kapiti area (although that does not mean it will be in those areas specially- it is just to give people an idea). We want to see Surge build on the last three years, and we want to see the numbers of people &ldquo;Surging&rdquo; increase. While we don&rsquo;t measure success in numbers, we do want to make as easy as we can for people to attend- the more people we have bringing vans, the more people they can, in turn, bring. So it made sense to have a location that is as central as we could get. Glen has put together a diverse wee team to dream, critique, re-think, Surge 10; if you have any more feedback/questions/thoughts, then flick him an email <a href="mailto:taranaki@incedo.org.nz">taranaki@incedo.org.nz</a></p>
  <p>There are a number of Incedo people busy with end of term essays, exams, installations, and assignments for various study commitments. We all pray Gods peace/rest/joy/sanity/refreshment at this busy time of the year.</p>
  <p>So as we bid a fond farewell to you, we leave you with the words of Vinnie Jones from the movie Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels:</p>
  <p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been emotional&rdquo;</em></p>
