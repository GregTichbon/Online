  <p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>This Thursday I will be meeting with Neil O&rsquo;Boyle (the new YFC Asia Pacific Director), and Dave Banao (one of his Team and former YFC AU ND). Besides my time with them, we will also we spending time at the Vision Youth Conference that Tim and his team are running. We then head to Hamilton where they will also be meeting with Blair, Tracy, and Hannah over the weekend. On the agenda will be, amongst other things, some honest conversation about the future relationship between Incedo and YFC International. </p>
  <p>The MLT recognized some time ago that we needed to define what our relationship looked like with YFCI and how we would relate in the future. So in Thailand this year, I started a conversation with Neil (and his predecessor Scott) as to how we move forward together. This conversation was built on the solid foundation laid by Gus, Darryl, Mal, and Mike over many years of relating to YFCI- I acknowledge that history and the time and effort each of them put into our journey as part of YFCI.</p>
  <p>To be a member nation of YFCI with full voting rights, you must fill out and sign a charter document as well as report on a number of areas (how many staff, how many people were exposed to the gospel, how many made a decision etc). Incedo is now at a point in our relationship where there are now obvious differences between ourselves and YFCI when it comes to &ldquo;filling out the forms&rdquo;, there are also differences in how we structure ourselves, how we approach leadership, how we view ministry; and it is fair to say that there has been (sometimes rigorous) dialogue between Incedo and YFCI about our name. </p>
  <p>Having said all this, we do not want these differences to define our future relationship, rather we want to discover how exactly we do relate as we do share a common hope in Jesus and a desire to see people embrace Him. So we choose to be upfront and honest (when the easy option would be to keep &ldquo;ticking the boxes&rdquo;). This honesty may cost us in one sense, yet I believe that complete honesty is the best foundation for any relationship, there are potential outcomes of this meeting, but at this moment in time there is no point in trying to say what or will not happen as a result of our time together.</p>
  <p>So while, this weekend, we could spend hours discussing the finer points of international chartering- we won&rsquo;t; while we could get into a &ldquo;bun fight&rdquo; about the fine print- we won&rsquo;t; we will however, talk about the future. Out conversations will be proactive as opposed to reactive, and we will let our desire for healthy and honest relationships lead the way. </p>
  <p>This meeting does mark a significant point in our journey as part of YFCI, and that is the reason for this update- we want the Incedo Community to know where &ldquo;we are at&rdquo;, as well as asking for prayer on our behalf. We also want to communicate that it is our desire to find a way forward with YFCI, as there is still a role for us to play in the Asia Pacific region. That role will be defined, as it always has been, by service and generosity to our brothers and sisters who serve Jesus in many difficult situations. </p>
  <p>If there are any words, or images that come to mind as you pray for this weekend, please txt or email them to me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Shalom<br>
