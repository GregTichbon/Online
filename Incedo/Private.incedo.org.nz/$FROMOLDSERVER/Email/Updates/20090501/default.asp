  <p align="left"><strong>MLT UPDATE</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Shalom ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left"> I am sitting in the Wainuiomata High School staff room just before interval and it is dead quiet. Soon it will be filled with the sound of staff drinking coffee and tea, eating their various cakes and biscuits; there will be laughter, and there will be frustration. What ever occurs, the staff room is fulfilling its function. But at the moment, in the silence, it is just a collection of slightly worn chairs, tables covered with half read papers, and empty cups on the shelf.</p>
  <p>For some of the staff whom are about to bring life into this space it is a place of networking, for others a sanctuary from the students, for some it is where they build friendships, and for others it is just a place to take the load off for a while. Yet the staffroom is a place where outsiders know they are outsiders, where they feel like outsiders, and where they are treated as outsiders. At the end of the break, the staff leave, and it is quiet again- the room has served its purpose. It is a limited purpose though, as it stands empty more than it is ever full; as soon as the staff leave for the day or holidays it no longer matters it is simply a room with a function. So I sit and I think, in fact I think about Surge.</p>
  <p>I like Surge- I like it a lot; in fact it is a highlight of my year (and the other blokes from Wainui). Why? Well firstly it&rsquo;s not like the staff room. There is no distinction between ages, gender, and faith journey. There are no reserved cups, or seats that are for certain people, there is no special jargon, we do not label our food in the fridge.</p>
  <p>There is only the work that needs to be done, the food that needs to be eaten, and the fun that needs to be had; and there is us. Just the &ldquo;us&rdquo; at Surge, there is no &ldquo;them&rdquo;. All have been, are, and will be welcome at Surge. Secondly, Surge is a window into the life of Incedo. It is a reflection of our values and it reflects the Christ in us. </p>
  <p>Now we need to look at how we can build on our three years of Surge, it is time to reflect, critique, dream, pray, and plan. We are committed to Surge being our &ldquo;flagship event&rdquo; So that when people ask &ldquo;What, Who, Why Incedo?&rdquo; We can point to Surge. So Surge will look different next year, yet what will not change is our desire to fully explore how all our values can better be expressed by Surge10, Surge11, and so on.</p>
  <p>We will make an announcement about the location and dates of Surge in the next couple of weeks. We will also have some news on how the planning of Surge will take place over the next year.</p>
  <p><strong>Who? What? Where?</strong></p>
  <p>Just a brief run down on who is doing what and where over the next month or so. Remember there is the events forum on the member&rsquo;s page, if you want to keep up with what&rsquo;s going on (you never know, you might want go and hang and help). </p>
  <p><strong>Mark C and Lisa</strong> are currently in Fiji for the Summer Sizzler Camp, no doubt being run off their feet by a bunch of kids. </p>
  <p><strong>Andy</strong> is hosting Rollin&rsquo; 4 Da kidz- <a href="http://rollin4dakidz.wordpress.com">http://rollin4dakidz.wordpress.com</a> in Gisborne on 22-23rd May (Friday 7pm to Sat 7pm). It&rsquo;s a 24-hour sk8athon to raise funds for World Vision; it is Andy&rsquo;s great way of doing the 40 Hour Famine differently this year. A few of us will be there, if you can&rsquo;t make it- why not sponsor a skater and help save a life. </p>
  <p><strong>Glen</strong> is opening up New Plymouth to us all this Queens Birthday Weekend. It is a chance for people to relax and hang in the mighty Naki. There is some space at Glens, or plenty of motels, campsites, etc plenty for people to book into.</p>
  <p><strong>Sue G</strong> has accepted a role on the Board- Sue brings a huge wealth of experience, wisdom, discernment, and like Tracy, a sense of style to our meetings. Having her as part of the leadership of Incedo excites us, and we look forward to her input over the next season.</p>
  <p><strong>Melody</strong> has like wise accepted a role with the MLT. Melody&rsquo;s experience and perspectives will add colour and flavour to the MLT.</p>
  <p><strong>Scotty</strong> is running &ldquo;Northland has got talent&rdquo; on May 15 and 16. He is also hosting the &ldquo;Extreme Famine Ultimate Sleep&rdquo; over the 40 hour famine weekend- there will be hungry little mouths for 40 hours, why not sponsor one?</p>
  <p><strong>Darryl G and Mike Garland</strong> will be offering two weekends training for those who connect with young people. This will be invaluable to those who are just starting out, and those who have been around a while. Both Mike and Darryl have a vast and rich history with young people, and are more than qualified to deliver these weekends. We are opening this up to people outside of Incedo as well, this is as a service to them and not some attempt at recruitment. More details will be sent out ASAP.</p>
  <p>South Island: 27-28 June in Christchurch co-ordinated by Hannah, Paul and Tracy <br>
    North Island: 22 &amp; 23 August in Palmerston North co-ordinated by Melody, Karl, Glen and Blair</p>
  <p><strong>In the next update</strong><br>
    More info on the Training weekends, Paul will be sharing a nice scone recipe, and Hannah will tell you the correct etiquette for dinning with Heads of State. Plus- Angelina, Brad, and Madonna- the truth behind the rumours that they want to adopt us all. </p>
