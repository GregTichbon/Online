  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>Good day to you...<br>
    <br>
    The countdown begins....<br>
    1 month and a couple of weeks, (or) six weeks on Friday, (or) 43 sleeps.<br>
    The mighty south is looking forward to embracing other Incedo-ers<br>
    Timaru is sometimes known as the heart of the mainland, it is close to the big cities, the ski fields and lakes, while having some amazing views and beautiful spaces. There are also some awesome custard squares... like nothing you've ever tasted (you are totally missing out if you don't like custard squares).<br>
    <br>
    So...<br>
    <br>
    Now for some questions:<br>
    Are you (and your whanau) coming south?<br>
    What are your food preferences? - allergies, preferences, issues with<br>
    If you were to eat Indian food, how do you like the flavour? mild, medium, hot, burning (so hot it burns your taste buds off)<br>
    <br>
    Now for some action:<br>
    I would love to hear back from you, preferable by Queens birthday weekend, but at the latest (June 14)<br>
    Please write/describe/artistically mention a secret or thought about life, God, etc on a postcard size card (example follows)<br>
    Also, think about how you would describe different parts of your journey in 6 words.<br>
    <br>
    Cheers</p>
