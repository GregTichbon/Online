  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">Welcome to summer... Although, as I look outside today it doesn't seem very summery; and then to think that this is the last month of 2009. My family had a tradition that on the 31st of Decemeber the extended Bruce family and Gran-ma (Mum's mum) would get together and talk about the highlights of the year that had been and the things we wanted to achieve in the coming year... every now and then, when Mum has a big clean up she finds one of our lists that was written down. How do we celebrate the year that has been, the times we have gathered together, laughed and enjoyed each others company? And the moments that we have struggled through, sickness, pain and death? Each of those moments make us as people and as they shape us, they also shape those around us - we are in this together. I apologised to one of my mates the other day, because I'd been in a pretty crappy mood around him; he looked me in the eyes and said 'Teams care for each other, and we are a team'. So true... and yet, often we struggle to see ourselves as part of a team, when we are in an area by ourself or when we are feeling alone. <br>
    <br>
    As we reflect on the year that has been, and write new dates into our diaries for the coming year; I'm able to give you the exciting news of where our weekend get-togethers and the gathering will be:<br>
    <br>
    The weekends are (remember you can chose two of the three to go to):<br>
    Feburary 12-14 will be held in Auckland<br>
    July 9-11 will be held in Timaru<br>
    November 19-21 will be held in Gisborne<br>
    <br>
    The Gathering (September 24-29) will be held in Christchurch.<br>
    <br>
    As you gather with family and friends to celebrate Christmas and Jesus' journey on earth walking as human amongst our humanity... I hope that you will continue to feel His presence and see His fingerprints in people's lives around you. May the challenge that a new year brings excite you, give you opportunities to step out of your comfort zone with others and take time to refresh your spirit in whatever way you do.</p>
