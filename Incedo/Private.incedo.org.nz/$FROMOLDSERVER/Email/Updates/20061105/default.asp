  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">    <strong>Bible Reading<br>
  </strong>We are already into November. The reading for this month is Isaiah (it 
    contains the most prophecies concerning the life of Jesus). If nothing else by the end of 
    the year you know you will have read 12 books of the Bible along with the 
    other 56 members of YFCNZ&hellip;.pretty cool aye!</p>
  <p><strong>Surge. 19th -22nd April, 2007<br>
  </strong>This is well under way with Scott, Greg and Glen are making some very good 
    contacts in Wanganui. This has the potential to really identify us as we 
    want to be known in the future&hellip;.both with others and with ourselves.</p>
  <p> More information will come out as the plans are solidified, but for now make
      sure the dates are booked in. Remember that all members must attend and no 
      one will be accepted as a member if they are not there.</p>
  <p><strong>Membership Ethos weekends</strong><br>
    As previously stated there will be two weekends in February and all those 
    wanting to be considered for membership after the next Gathering will need to attend one of 
    these along with Surge. The dates are 10th &shy; 11th February for the North 
    island and the 24th &shy; 25th Feb for the South Island. As stated previously the event 
    will start on Saturday with Lunch and finish on the Sunday with lunch. We 
    still have to confirm venues but make sure you have the dates in your 
    diaries now.</p>
  <p><strong>The Gathering Date Change to the 15th &shy; 17th June 2007<br>
  </strong>We said in the last update that we were going to have the Gathering over 
    Queens Birthday weekend next year. After some discussion, and with some members 
    suggesting this weekend could be used for other things, the MLT have changed
    the date to 15th &shy; 17th June 2007</p>
  <p><strong>How we are going to fund ourselves in the future<br>
  </strong>One of the distinctives on YFC has been that we are primarily a faith based 
    mission in our finances. The changes have meant that we have stopped or 
    planted as separate entities those projects that were funded by the 
    government leaving us with a lot less income&hellip;..excellent stuff! Over the 
    past 40 or so years however we have built up a good asset base in the YFC 
    buildings that are around NZ. The question that the Board and MLT have been 
    grappling with is how to best use these assets for the good of the wider 
    mission. The Board have been working on a <a href="20061105/FinancingYFCNZ.pdf">summary paper</a> which they have 
    accepted as the way forward. Basically it says the various buildings and 
    funds that are from building sales will be vested with a Trust or similar 
    whose job is to maximise the returns on the assets. While the Board of 
    YFCNZ will have ultimate ownership the Trust will be separate from YFC and 
    will manage the buildings etc. The return on the investments, which will 
    come from rental income etc will go the National board for disbursements 
    based on the principles in the paper. In practice there should be no change 
    to anyone&rsquo;s income for the next 1 &shy; 2 years, in fact things get better 
    locally as we will be stopping the quota payments from the end of November. 
    Bryan will be in contact with those of you that have invested funds from the 
    sale of assets to let you know how to transfer these funds when required.</p>
  <p>The mission giving will also stop at some stage shortly as we look at better 
    ways of staying generous and also connected with the missions that we give 
    to. Please contact anyone on the Board or MLT if you have questions. The 
    key here is to realise how God has been good to us over the years and we 
    should be incredibly grateful, that we are in this position.</p>
  <p><strong>Members forum</strong><br>
      Remember this is that place to read on comment on issues that shape our 
      thinking. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.membersforum.org.nz">http://www.membersforum.org.nz</a>&rdquo;</p>
  <p><strong>Finally</strong><br>
      We are constantly amazed at how the prayer update is not only useful in 
      praying with each other but also in keeping in touch with what is going on 
      around NZ.</p>
