  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left">I have always enjoyed the family holiday; go away, explore somewhere new, visit places that you've never been before, and most 
    importantly enjoy the friendship of those around you. My family had a rule - we would go holidaying where there was no cellphone 
    coverage... scary but true. Uncle Dan and Dad would start their gold-panning early, and usually scouted some crazy place for us to 
    visit as their was possible gold. The communion between the two men was strong, sitting beside the river, figuring out how they would 
    spend the millions they make in the week we were staying there... and pretty much just sharing life.</p>
  <p align="left">We all have stories from our family holidays, whether it is being trapped in the tent while it poured with rain, or the sun-burn that taught 
      you not to do that again (until the following summer). In thinking about my times holidaying... I believe I'm going to have to add our 
      Auckland weekend to the mix. It was relaxed, there was time to play crazy games (and I'm sure Karl will be practicing the stick game 
      for a rematch next time he's up there), saw dinosaurs!! and being about to spend time with good friends.</p>
  <p align="left">The essence of relationship and time spent together emerged in the weekend. </p>
  <p align="left">We talked, we laughed, we experienced Auckland through Mal, Laura, Tim and the team... we prayed, we created, and farewelled the 
        Miriams.<br>
        Our values flowed through our time together.</p>
  <p align="left"> Once again a big thanks to the Auckland crew - It was really good.</p>
