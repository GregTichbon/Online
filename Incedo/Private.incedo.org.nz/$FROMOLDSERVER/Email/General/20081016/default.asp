  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname|| </p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FFFF00">There are two items for your information on the following email. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong>UNOH family visit to New Zealand </strong></p>
  <p>Below is an e-mail from a couple we met in Melbourne while attending &ldquo;Surrender 08&rdquo;. They are part of UNOH, the mission order in Australia and Bangkok and elsewhere who helped us on our journey to becoming Incedo.</p>
  <p>You can see from the e-mail below that Pete and Sharm and their 2 young children are coming to NZ for a break.</p>
  <p>Can we help them in any way with places to stay and transport?</p>
  <p>Please let me know if you can help or just e-mail Pete and Sharm directly; <a href="mailto:pblair@unoh.org">pblair@unoh.org</a> (but maybe copy me; <a href="mailto:m.green@incedo.org.nz">m.green@incedo.org.nz</a> and Dave Tims;<a href="mailto:d.tims@incedo.org.nz"> d.tims@incedo.org.nz</a>  to let us know what&rsquo;s happening).</p>
  <p>Cheers</p>

    <em>Pete and Sharm here and&hellip;we&rsquo;re finally coming to Aotearoa! Don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ll be there whilst we&rsquo;re travelling, our dates are from 8th November to 29th of November. We were wondering if there was anyone in the Incedo network who might be available to put us up for anytime in that period. We were planning on mostly spending time on the North Island unless there is an option for the South. I can&rsquo;t remember who it was who we met at Surrender (was it Mal Green??) but he suggested emailing the incedo before we come. Also, if there was a car available that would be terrific. We haven&rsquo;t got any concrete plans yet, except to meet up with Catherine and Gabriel at Taranaki on the 13th to 14th for a climb and a walk. Can you let us know if any of this is do-able? Ta amigo, muchos gracias, maybe see you there, here&rsquo;s hoping! </em>  </p>

  <p><strong>Scott Rosene's farewell</strong></p>
  <p>Just an idea. If you are not able to make it to Scott's farewell, perhaps you could make a short video message on youtube or put it on a CD/DVD and post it to PO Box 497, Wanganui. </p>
  <p>Check it out at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbmMBkazCy0">www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbmMBkazCy0</a></p>
  <p>If you want to post a video response on youtube but don't have an account you can use incedonz. The password is 6values</p>
