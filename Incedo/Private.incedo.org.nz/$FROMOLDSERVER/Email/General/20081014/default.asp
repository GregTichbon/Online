  <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FFFF00">The following is a reminder of the members update sent out on 17 September 2008. We have not had any replies. Please can you reply asap. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Scott Rosene's Farewell</strong></p>
  <p>As you know Scott has decided to resign from Incedo, feeling his time in specific youth ministry has come to an end for now. He has been on sabatical for the last couple of months and has confirmed that he is leaving.</p>
  <p>We would like to honour Scott and his commitment and so have decided to have an evening together on Friday 24 October. This will be a resteraunt dinner followed by dessert at Scott's house (ex Incedo office). We would love you to be part of this. Please get back to Melody (027 7125612, <a href="mailto:m.winters@incedo.org.nz">m.winters@incedo.org.nz</a>) or Greg (027 2495088, <a href="mailto:g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz">g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz</a>) and let us know whether you can make it or not. If you can't come you may like to send your greetings to Scott or to Melody or I to pass on on the night.</p>
  <p>Look forward to hearing from you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Melody, Greg, Bryan and Rochelle </p>
