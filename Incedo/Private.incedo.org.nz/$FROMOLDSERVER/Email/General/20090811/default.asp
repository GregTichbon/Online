        <p>Kia Ora!</p>
        <p> How&rsquo;s it going? As you may or may not know we, the Gathering Planning Team, had a couple of meetings to unpack and rigorously discuss what the Gathering could look like this year. Our aim as the Gathering Team is to create a time and space for all Incedo members and whanau to partake in Community. There are a myriad of ways to achieve this.</p>
        <p> And to that end we have put together this letter for you and your base to mull over and help us with one of the ways we think this could happen.</p>
        <p> We are proposing that a member from your Incedo Community, someone who has not been around that long perhaps or someone whose perspectives are not usually heard at national hui like the Gathering. We would love to have them share with the rest of the Incedo Whanau about their experience within the Incedo Whanau.</p>
        <p> Below are a couple of questions that might be helpful or worth considering if someone is willing to share:</p>
        <p> <strong>Questions for Centre/ Bases/ Communities:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>  What is some of the good and the bad that you have encountered as community/base/centre on your Incedo journey so far?</li>
          <li> What are your dreams for your community, Incedo and for yourself?</li>
          <li> How do you feel about, how what you are doing fits within Incedo?</li>
          <li> How have the values influenced your mahi (work) as a &ldquo;member&rdquo; of Incedo?</li>
        </ul>        <p> We understand that this &lsquo;person&rsquo; might not be in your community, if so, we would love to hear anyone share about their experience within Incedo. At the same time you&rsquo;re not obligated to share either. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yours in Christ,<br>
          The Gathering Extravaganza Planning Team!<br>
          (Laura, Andy, Hannah, Mark J and Melody)</p>
        <p> Please email Andy: <a href="mailto:gisborne@incedo.org.nz">gisborne@incedo.org.nz</a> if you are keen to share! Further details will be sent out once we get some feedback.<br>
