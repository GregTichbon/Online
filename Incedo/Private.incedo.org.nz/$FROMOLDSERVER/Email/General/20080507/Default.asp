  <p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p><strong>A message from Alex and Sarah Britton </strong></p>
  <p>Our 8 day journey begins this Sunday and we would really appreciate your prayers. </p>
  <p> The journey is the main part of the 2 term program we are running and is designed to be the catalyst for change in the lives of the young people we are working with.</p>
  <p> If you would like to follow our progress more closely, you can view the route in Google Earth by downloading our route <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/private/email/general/20080507/2008Journey.kmz">here</a>. If you do not already have this program, you can download it by clicking <a href="http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html%20">here</a>.</p>
  <p> Once you have done that, open up the '2008Journey.kmz' file  and our route plan will be opened up for you in Google Earth. Once opened, click on the 'Tools' option from the top menu list, then click on the 'Play Tour' option. The routes in green are where we will be on foot, red is the bike section and blue is the kayak sections. If all goes according to plan, each night we will be at the numbered camp sites, although this isn't always the case and a flatish section of track may sometimes be our campsite! :)</p>
  <p> Please pray for safety, for wisdom in our conversations with our group, for awesome oppertunities, for non-involvement of search and rescue teams, and for inifinite patience! heh heh.</p>
  <p> We head off at 11.30am Sunday the 11th, and will hopefully be returning around 4pm Sunday the 18th. </p>
  <p> Cheers</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
