Hi ||usefirstname||
<p>  We now have the certificate of registration from the Charities Commission. This is what is needed for funding applications etc. </p>
<p>You can find it <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/private/Documents/Documents/CharitiesCertificate.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>Note we are now officially Incedo...NOT YFC.<br>
  <br>
  God Bless<br>
  </p>
