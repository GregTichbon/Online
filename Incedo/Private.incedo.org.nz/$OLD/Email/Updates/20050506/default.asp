<body>Dear ||usefirstname||
<p>We just wanted to make brief contact with you all.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Converge</font></strong> (used to be called North Island Training)</p>
<p>We just finished this last weekend at Taupo. It was a great time and some of the comments we have received are very encouraging. Part of one email said: </p>
<p><em>XX felt &quot;at home&quot; with YFC and also went out of her way to buy something for the generosity room, felt God dealing with her in the reflective times, felt peace, loved the small group work, danced till she could dance no more, felt accepted and cared for by people she had never met before, &hellip;..</em></p>
<p>Paul from Timaru and Sarah and Julie from Nelson were there and will be planning South Island Converge so we are looking forward to that.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">YFC Conference</font></strong> (From the Monday &ndash; Wednesday after CTC)</p>
<p>This is for all members and compulsory for all part and full time staff. We realize that as it is during the week most volunteer members won&rsquo;t be able to make it but all are welcome. Registration details are on the YFC web page  <a href="http://www.yfc.org.nz/private/registration">www.yfc.org.nz/private/registration</a> (This will be online from Wednesday 11 May). Tony Campolo will be speaking and we are also going to have a range of professionals to input to everyone there. We hope to have Drs, physiotherapists, prayer ministry people etc. If you know of such a person who could be available please let one of us know. Our contact details are below.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Practices</font></strong></p>
<p>John is the <strong>Gospel</strong> we are all reading this month so please make sure you have a plan to do this. Remember reading the word of God is always good for us so don&rsquo;t treat it as a job but as a chance to learn more about Jesus who we follow.</p>
<p>You should really be meeting with a <strong>prayer partner</strong> each week and praying for each member of your team weekly&hellip;and they should be for you!</p>
<p>Depending on your area the monthly <strong>discipleship</strong> teas should be happening. Christchurch&rsquo;s first is coming up on the 18th may combined with a Vision night for the wider community to show that YFC is alive and well. </p>
<p>As a team you should be discussing and deciding what non YFC <strong>community project</strong> you can assist with this year.</p>
<p>As a team after each event you should be asking how you <strong>represented Jesus</strong>. He is the reason we do what we do. </p>
<p>We will be sending out some information on what a <strong>spiritual coach</strong> does and also some <strong>Project Serve</strong> ideas in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>We appreciate all of you and its good to know we are together learning what it means to follow Jesus as we areach out to the lost youth of this land.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact us at any time</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
