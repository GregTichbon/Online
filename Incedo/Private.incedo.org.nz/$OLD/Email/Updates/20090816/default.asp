  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p align="left"> We are at a very exciting, yet challenging place in our journey as a mission. Incedo has been underway for a couple of years now; we are an eclectic bunch of people who serve in ways that are as diverse and unique as we are.</p>
  <p align="left">This time last year we had been in a process of dialoguing and consultation with members; at The Gathering, Glen and Tracy took us through a process that allowed conversations to start around different aspects of our communal life. One area of conversation/challenge was around the question &ldquo;How do we build a nation wide community?&rdquo; </p>
  <p align="left">          As we ask people to consider membership for 2009/2010, it makes sense to communicate our response to the above question. We have tried various approaches, with various responses in the past. We have talked with people; we have encouraged people to take the initiative (and some have).</p>
  <p align="left">In this particular area we do feel that the time for consultation is over, as we have dialogued with people over the past couple of years; and yet we find ourselves asking the same question. The MLT have reached a decision about the next step in our journey towards being a nation wide community, and how we answer that question. </p>
  <p align="left">As we all know we have members lead Surge annually, this years Gathering is being run by members, we have members offering training weekends, and we have had members offer spiritual retreats. What excited us is that the MLT runs none of these; we turn up and take the lead from our fellow members. But now we feel we do need to take a lead with one aspect of our nation wide community. That is in the area of our time together as a community.</p>
  <p align="left">While we admire UNOH, Servants, Jesus People, etc; they are not us and we cannot be them. We need keep discovering our path, we need to ask God to illuminate that path for us, and we need to define who weare becoming. We need to spend more time together in seeking God&rsquo;s light and direction for us, we need to spend more time in prayer as a community, to be blunt- we need to spend more time together.</p>
  <p align="left">This is not a time to invite others to come and speak, it is not a time to read more books; it is a time for God to &ldquo;pour new wine&rdquo; into &ldquo;new wineskins&rdquo;.</p>
  <p align="left">This is the role that we see the younger members taking a lead in; this was clearly evident to the MLT when we gathered with some of them in Christchurch earlier in the year. We have seen Hannah and Melody come onto the MLT team, and we will be all taking part in the Gathering, which has been planned, and will be run, by our younger members. </p>
  <p align="left">We want to reconfirm, once again, that we are called to members of Incedo NZ first and foremost. We are not, for example, members of Wellington Incedo who have some national connections. We are Incedo NZ, and to be a nation wide community requires us to spend time together.</p>
  <p align="left">Most of us do gather for Surge, and the Gathering; some have gathered for a spiritual retreat, and some accepted an open invitation to Taranaki. Some of us headed to Hamilton for Trees at the Meteor or Stations, and some made it to Gisborne to &ldquo;Roll for da Kids&rdquo;. While we celebrate these times when we have gathered, we acknowledge that in our next season we want to discover what it means to become a nation wide community. That is best achieved when we can be together, eat together, and worship together.</p>
  <p align="left">So, as the Leadership of Incedo, we are calling the Incedo Members to gather more regularly next year. As it has been in the past, Members are required to be at both Surge and the Gathering; and in addition we have also included 3 more weekends spread over the year. Members can choose 2 out of the 3 weekends to attend, as we want to give space for people sitting exams, people dealing with the start of school term, and those with work commitments. </p>
  <p align="left">Friday 12th-Sunday 14th Feb (weekend)<br>
      Wednesday 14th-Saturday 17th April (Surge)<br>
      Friday 9th-Sunday 11th July (weekend)<br>
      Friday 24th-Wednesday 29th Sept (Gathering)<br>
      Friday 20th-Sunday 22nd Nov (weekend)<br>
      <br>
      Surge is the last week of the school holidays (as the first weekend is Easter), so therefore we finish on the Saturday, and then people have a day to relax before school/work/etc on the Monday.<br>
      <br>
      As members are people are committed to Incedo, and also committed to discovering what it means to &ldquo;do community&rdquo; across NZ; we know these weekends will be a time that we look forward to. </p>
  <p>This is a &ldquo;step up&rdquo; for Incedo and this, for some, may present some challenge; but we see it as a necessary step for us if are to build a nation wide community that is founded on relationships and love for one another. </p>
  <p>With this step we are saying that our focus for the next year is relationships with one another, and building a sense of unity that we feel- no matter where in the country we live and serve. We simply cannot ignore the fact that unless we start to gather more, we will never achieve the sense of relationship with one another that we have always talked and dreamed about. </p>
  <p>As you will know, last year we asked people to commit to 2 years of membership, what we are communicating above does not detract from that at all; we feel we need to take seriously some of the issues that have been raised by people over the last year. Under our constitution, membership has to be renewed on a yearly basis; we ask you to, once again, prayerfully consider what God is saying to you at this point in our journey. <br>
