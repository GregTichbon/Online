  <p align="left">Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>    Hello.</p>
  <p> Once again, as we creep closer to the Gathering and make our plans to head to Canterbury Plains... there are a few little tasks that need to be completed beforehand. Attached is the <a href="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20100810/membershipform.pdf">membership form for 2010</a> and the 'Incedo New Zealand statement of Belief'. Please read through these carefully and prayerfully as you make your decision for the coming year.</p>
  <p>We are here to listen to any comments you have, and if you would like the opportunity to process membership with us. As with any stage of life, we look forward to the journey we are 
      travelling together and take wisdom from the past.</p>
  <p> It has been good to have the extra weekends together as opportunities to experience different flavours of those around the country. In the coming year we won't be having compulsory weekends, but we would love to see times during the year that members are able to get together and share each other's company.</p>
  <p> NB: dates for both Surge11 and the Gathering (2011) are to be confirmed.<br>
      It is important that we receive the membership forms by Friday 3rd September.</p>
  <p> Please post a signed physical copy of the membership form to:</p>
  <p>P O Box 133<br>
    Timaru 7940</p>
  <p>May your day be beautiful and a smile touch your lips.</p>
  <p>Regards</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Melody, Karl and Hannah<br>
