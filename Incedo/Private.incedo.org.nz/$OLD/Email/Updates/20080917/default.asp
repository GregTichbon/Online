  <p align="left"><strong>Set the Record Straight!!!<br>
    </strong>
    <br>
    Preston and LeeAnn McBrayer have come from the USA to work with Scottie at our Northland base, for 12 months. <br>
    <br>
    Last night while on an evenings fishing, their car was broken into, and credit cards, drivers licence, cash, and IPod stolen. The cards were used to rack up hundreds of dollars of purchases.<br>
    <br>
    Yep, the banks and insurance will eventually sort a lot of this out, BUT:<br>
    <br>
    Its a lousy welcome to NZ, and there are always lots of costs in getting things replaced.<br>
    <br>
    SO, this is a request to: <br>
    <br>
    1. Pray for them<br>
    2. Send a greeting (<a href="mailto:northland@incedo.org.nz">northland@incedo.org.nz</a>)<br>
    3. Generously send them some $$$ (c/-Incedo POBox 1450, Whangarei)<br>
    <br>
    It would be great if by the end of this week they had a personal story to tell, of Incedo's generosity and concern for each other. <br>
    <br>
    It would set the record straight on Kiwi's. And after the glorious sporting weekend we've had, how can we resist!<br>
    <br>
    We wont send any reminders out about this. We'll leave it to you to action!!</p>

  <p><strong>Scott Rosene's Farewell</strong></p>
  <p>As you know Scott has decided to resign from Incedo, feeling his time in specific youth ministry has come to an end for now. He has been on sabatical for the last couple of months and has confirmed that he is leaving.</p>
  <p>We would like to honour Scott and his commitment and so have decided to have an evening together on Friday 24 October. This will be a resteraunt dinner followed by dessert at Scott's house (ex Incedo office). We would love you to be part of this. Please get back to Melody (027 7125612, <a href="mailto:m.winters@incedo.org.nz">m.winters@incedo.org.nz</a>) or Greg (027 2495088, <a href="mailto:g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz">g.tichbon@incedo.org.nz</a>) and let us know whether you can make it or not. If you can't come you may like to send your greetings to Scott or to Melody or I to pass on on the night.</p>
  <p>Look forward to hearing from you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
