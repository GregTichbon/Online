<title>YFC Members Update</title>

<p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
<p>Greetings for the first members update for 2006.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Gathering</u></strong> is approaching and, as stated in the last update, is now on from the <u><strong>31st March – 2nd April</strong></u>.  The venue is Forest Lakes Camp in Otaki.  This is a different date and location than originally stated so make sure you change your diary.  Remember the Gathering is for all members of YFCNZ and includes the AGM.  In early March we will be sending out more information but we are hoping to equalise travel etc so please book now and let us know what you can pay.</p>
<p>A <u><strong>Members Review</strong></u>  will also be sent to each of you in the next 2 weeks or so.  This is to help us all reflect on how we are going as a mission community and how we are progressing with the practices.  The review will be done as a peer system where you will meet with 2 – 5 other members and share your reflections (based on the forms we are sending you).  It is also aimed at helping you determine whether you want to stay a member for 2006.</p>
<p>We also agreed at Senior Leadership Conference to start an <u><strong>Associate Membership</strong></u>.  This is for those who are wanting to be committed to the community as helpers but are not able to fulfil the full membership practices.  An associate will have fewer practices to maintain but will have more commitment to the community than someone who just helps occasionally in a mission project.</p>
<p>It's also a good time to thank the Lord for Canvas, Summer Harvest and Southern Harvest.  What a great opportunity to input into young people!</p>
<p>This year is a year of building towards the future.  We have been through some tough changes but are now coming out and need to focus our energies on being who God want us to be and out of that doing what God wants us to do….it's all part of the faith adventure.</p>
<p> Let us know if you have any comments or questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Darryl, Gus and Mal <br>
