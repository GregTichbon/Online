Hello fellow missionaries
<p>We plan to send out an update to all YFC members about once a month. You also get the prayer update weekly which is coordinated by Taranaki (Thanks heaps Marfell crew!). </p>
<p>Firstly thanks everyone for CTC. It was great to see so many young people from all over NZ expressing some of their God given creative potential. As always the highlights was seeing God doing his work in young lives.</p>
<p>YFC Conference was also a great time. We will have DVDs of Campolos talks (Scottie is organising this&hellip;thanks Scottie) available in 2 weeks or so which will also have his interview with Linda Clarke on nine to noon and his Holmes interview. Darryl will send you details of how to get copies when they are available. </p>
<p>Great news. Paul Keane is engaged to Jo in December in Timaru. There are some exciting developments in Timaru so it&rsquo;s a busy time for them.</p>
<p>Southland now have the ex Yone van which is an answer to prayer for them and all part of our value of generosity.</p>
<p>Finally by now you should all be regularly doing a number of the common practices of membership such as; meeting with a prayer partner weekly, meeting with a spiritual coach 4 times a year, praying for your team weekly, asking how you portrayed Jesus after each event and reading a Gospel each month (Mathew for June). As a team you should also be looking at how you will be involved in a non YFC community project (Mission through service). We discussed the idea of helping the new migrants arriving in NZ later this year and we will let you know as events unfold but don&rsquo;t hesitate to look at something local.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to understand or apply the practices please just contact one of the MLT. It does take a while to fully &lsquo;get&rsquo; some of them.</p>
<p>We also want to restate that we are in a proscriptive movement. This basically means that a member can do what ever the team want that fits the values (Unless stated otherwise) We are moving away from the &lsquo;permission giving&rsquo; idea. All we ask is that you keep us informed&hellip;&hellip;.just do it! Give it a go! Report back and don&rsquo;t be afraid of failing! We want to be able to report on failures too and celebrate those who are trying different initiatives!</p>
<p>Finally Gus and Marg are off on sabbatical for three months so contact Mal or Darryl from Saturday.</p>
<p>God Bless and let us know of how things are going. We love hearing from you.</p>
