  <p align="center"><strong><font size="+2">Board &amp; MLT Retreat</font></strong></p>
  <p>The Board and MLT of Incedo met recently; talking, praying, laughing, assessing, dreaming, questioning, eating, wrestling with issues, visioning, engaging.......... </p>
  <p>Incedo has reached a point on our journey where change has happened, systems have been created, a new culture is forming and people are feeling comfortable, settled in our Missional Community.</p>
  <p><em>Brilliant</em> yet also challenging!</p>
  <p>Barbara Jordan, an American civil rights activist and first African-American Senator in Texas said: </p>
  <p align="center"><em>&ldquo;We are a party of innovation. We do not reject our traditions, 
    but we are willing to adapt to changing circumstances, when change we must. <br>
    We are willing to suffer the discomfort of change in order to achieve a better future.&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p>The Board and MLT see&rsquo;s the need for us to continue to suffer the discomfort of change as we build our evolving Jesus community called Incedo. We must all be comfortable in the discomfort of the journey. Personally, we must all be open to adapt to changing circumstances, something that Incedo gives us all the freedom to explore.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong><font size="+2">Incedo ..... WHY?</font></strong></p>
  <p>We asked the question ... <strong>WHY</strong> does Incedo exist? We came up with these titles:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p> People &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community</p>
        <p> Belonging &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus</p>
        <p> Service &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom</p>
        <p> Explorers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pioneers<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>  <p>We asked the <strong>WHY</strong> question and created these sentences:</p>
  <p align="center"><em>A community where we have freedom to explore Jesus and love and serve him</em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>Journeying alongside young people and sharing Jesus - Missional community -<br>
    Freedom to respond</em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>Love God, Love people, nothing else matters</em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>Because we&rsquo;re on a journey that&rsquo;s values based - Jesus Centred, People Focused......</em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>A place to put handles on my faith. To love God and love others</em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>The freedom to follow Jesus, serve Him and journey alongside others</em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>People need to know they can meet Jesus where they&rsquo;re at</em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>A vehicle, tool, to love God and love people</em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>To be with Jesus where we find Him</em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>Acceptance and valued</em></p>
  <p>We asked the <strong>WHY</strong> question and Wordle created this for us:</p>
  <p><img src="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20110330/Why.jpg" width="550" height="397"></p>
  <p align="center"><strong><font size="+2">The Tree</font></strong></p>
  <p align="center">There was an image of a tree over the weekend. </p>
  <p align="center"> <img width="360" height="360" src="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20110330/TheTree.jpg"><br>
This tree has strong, aged, deep roots that help to sustain it, <br>
    allowing the tree to grow and flourish.</p>
  <p align="center">We were also reminded of an image that someone had a few years ago. </p>
  <p align="center"> <img width="296" height="447" src="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20110330/TreeFelled.jpg"><br>
Old trees need to be felled to allow light to penetrate <br>
    new shoots so they can grow. The new shoots are also <br>
    nourished by the old trees that have fallen.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong><font size="+2">&ldquo;Sitting comfortable in the grey&rdquo;</font></strong></p>
  <p> <img width="552" height="221" src="http://www.incedo.org.nz/Private/Email/Updates/20110330/comfortableinthegrey.jpg"><br>
    <br>
    This phrase came up during our conversations:<br>
      <br>
      How comfortable are we as a Jesus centred people sitting comfortable in the grey?</p>
  <p>Do we feel okay not having/needing all the answers?</p>
  <p>Being comfortable with theological questions where the answer isn't clear?</p>
  <p>It's not so much about the issues, but more about our attitudes?</p>
  <p>What do you think?</p>
  <p align="center"><strong><font size="+2">Scripture</font></strong></p>
  <p>We spent time reflecting in the two passages of scripture below. You may like to take time to carry out your own Lectio Divina on each separate passage, reflecting on them from your perspective as a member of our community.</p>
  <p align="center">John 3:10-21</p>
  <p align="center">Ephesians 2:14-22<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><strong><font size="+2">Conclusion</font></strong></p>
  <p>We hope that this update has given you some insight into where the Board and MLT are going and the challenges and opportunities we see in the coming days for Incedo, for you!</p>
  <p>Remember what Barbara Jordan said:</p>
  <p align="center"><em>&ldquo;we are willing to adapt to changing circumstances, when change we must. <br>
  We are willing to suffer the discomfort of change in order to achieve a better future.&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p>Constantly changing, adapting and growing is what is needed from us all. Yes it will be uncomfortable, yes it will be painful, yes it may even lose you some support money. But we are all in this community together, in this community that gives each of us the freedom to explore what it means to follow Jesus together, pioneering new expressions of Faith together. Growing and blossoming together into what God has for us all.</p>
