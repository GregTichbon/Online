          <strong>Incedo Members Update</strong><br>
		</p>
	        <p>As we busy ourselves with the bustle of the Christmas/Festive/Holiday season, be constantly aware of Immanuel &ndash; God not only with you, God with us, all of creation.</p>
	        <p>A really short update this month with a few key things, dates and places to take note of.</p>
	        <p><strong>Gathering 2014</strong><br>
          We're looking at either the 11-14 July or 3-6 October. Venues so far suggested are Rotorua or Taupo. Please let the MLT know <a href="maito:mlt@incedo.org.nz">mlt@incedo.org.nz</a> by <em>Thursday 5th December</em> if you are unable to do one, or either of these dates, or if you have any suggestions re location and how next year's Gathering could run. If you'd love to help put the weekend together, we'd love to know!</p>
	        <p><strong>Surge 2014</strong><br>
	          We can't confirm dates for Surge next year yet as we don't have a plan yet of who we want to engage with for Surge 2014. The MLT currently has one suggestion, but we'd love to hear your thoughts regarding a group/community/project that we could support over a Surge weekend. So please take a moment to email the MLT <a href="mailto:mlt@incedo.org.nz">mlt@incedo.org.nz</a> with your ideas, thoughts and dreams for next year's Surge. This needs to be done by <em>Thursday 5th December.</em></p>
	        <p><strong>Friends of Incedo</strong><br>
	          We have begun working on how we can make this more meaningful for people who're connected with Incedo, in what ever way. A small focus group is now working to create how we could be effective in nurturing and informing the friends of Incedo. If you have any thoughts or ideas, please contact Tracy <a href="mailto:t.bedford@incedo.org.nz">t.bedford@incedo.org.nz</a> She will then bring your suggestions to the focus group.</p>
	        <p><strong>New Initiative Fund</strong><br>
	          Just a gentle reminder that Incedo is committed to doing things differently. If you're inspired to create something new, something that's connected with serving young people, then make sure you contact Dave, Becs or Glen to talk about it. We're keen for Incedo to foster creative, new ways of serving Jesus and people.</p>
	        <p>Advent begins this Sunday, are you waiting? anticipating? the coming of the Hope, Joy, Peace and Love that the Chris Child brings?</p>
