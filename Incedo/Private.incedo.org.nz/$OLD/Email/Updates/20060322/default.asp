  <p>Dear ||usefirstname||</p>
  The MLT have been discussing some options for projects that we can all do, that reflect our mission mindset, our values, and our nationwide focus.
  <p>We have decided to work in with Amnesty International's Freedom week, July 31 - Aug 06. Heres how we see it working out: </p>
  <p><font size="+1">1. </font>Every YFC area will do something. Yours to decide. It can be as large or as small as you want. For instance, you could put on an Atomic style 
  event that focuses on issues of freedom, paying the price of convictions etc; or a BMX club could run a Freedom Air style event; or you could do 
  club programmes on the topic. </p>
  <p>But the goal is every area does something in that week. </p>
  <p><font size="+1">2.</font> At your event, Amnesty International issues will be promoted in some way; eg: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>encouraging kids to write letters on behalf of prisoners of conscience </li>
    <li>Promoting student membership of AI (free) or adult membership ($20 p.a.)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>HOW DOES THIS REFLECT THE NEW YFC?</p>
  <p><font size="+1">1. </font>Its missional. AI have 108 high school student groups throughout the country. That are all planning their own in-school Freedom Week events.</p>
  <p> AI will send them details of the events we set up, and enable us to make contact with them. These young people are all activist by nature. </p>
  <p><font size="+1">2. </font>We get to serve AI, an organization that champions human rights including those of Christians being persecuted for their faith. </p>
  <p><font size="+1">3. </font>We do something together without having to all do the same thing. And it doesnt require big dollar outlay. </p>
  <p>At the Gathering we will have AI info packs for you, and will spend a brief time brainstorming ideas to help with your own planning. </p>
  <p>We realise that 4 1/2 months may be short notice. You may already have other big events planned around that time. Thats not a problem - you can 
  either adapt them, or go for a club night option that doesnt require major planning. Or you could decide to find out what your local school AI group is 
  doing, and offer to help them with resources or personnel. </p>
  <p>In our view its a win win. Please give it some thought and come to the Gathering with ideas. </p>
