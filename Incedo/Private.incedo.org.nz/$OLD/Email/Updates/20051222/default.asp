<p>Dear ||usefirstname||
</p>
<p>We are sorry but we have  to change the dates of The Gathering '06. One of the responsibilities we have as an MLT in this beginning phase of the YFCNZ Mission Community, is to enable as many workers in the old YFCNZ organisation as possible and appropriate to transfer to the new YFCNZ Mission Community. Many have done this and, as an MLT, we have been thrilled to be part of this as we explore what being a mission community means. But some of the workers in the old YFC \NZ have had to deal with situations that have made it hard for them to move quickly and we have had to extend the time to 31 March for them to be fully committed to the new YFCNZ. The last of these involves the Wellington YFC Incorporated Society who have refused to wind up this year. The National Board have extended the time to the end of March 2006 (Wellington originally said they would decide at the end of June 2006). They will have either wound up as per the National Council instruction in April 2005 or they will be dissolved on that date. The National Board and Wellington are expecting a positive resolution will be the outcome and we can all move on together to map the future. </p>
<p>Therefore, we have had to change from the 10-12 Feb date for The Gathering '06 so that when we meet as members of the YFCNZ Mission Community we are all on the same understanding as to our relationship to each other and the community and can make decisions and enter into commitments without reservation. </p>
<p>The new date for The Gathering '06 is 31 March to 2 April. </p>
<p>We appreciate that this will cause inconvenience to members who are already fully committed to the YFCNZ Mission community and who have already planned their mission projects around, and travel bookings for, the February date. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused. Please let us know if we need to help you with any costs that are beyond the ability of your mission base to cover because of this change.</p>
<p>However, in this beginning stage of our journey as a mission community, we want to be as inclusive as we can as we move into the reconstruction stage of becoming a fully fledged YFCNZ Mission Community. We want to apply our values of Generosity, People-focused and Jesus-centered to this situation. We ask that we all apply these values to the change of dates also.</p>
<p>In the end it will be good to be together as group of Jesus followers trying to see where the Holy Spirit is leading us.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Thanks and have a great Christmas and even better Harvests or Canvas!</p>
