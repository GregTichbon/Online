  <p>Hey ||usefirstname||</p>
  <p>We have just come back from project serve trip helping Sereki and his team with a YFC Safari Camp which catered for 200 young people. Thank you so much for praying for us while a Category 4 Hurricane was heading straight for us in Labasa on Vanua Levu. Very close call but the hurricane decided to change course 1 hour before it was due to tear us apart. We are safe and alright. We were a little disappointed to not go through what would have been Fiji's largest hurricane to hit land. Afterwards talking to other people outside the camp we wouldn't have survived very well with the buildings we had. So praise God the hurricane was turned away.</p>
  <p>While over there and talking with Sereki we found out that he had cancelled his plans to bring his whole family over to NZ for a holiday. The reason being that some groups turned up with no money for there young people expecting Eki to cover it. He did but it effects him on a personal level where to cover the shortfall of Safari Camp he dipped into his on pockets and used the money they had saved for there NZ holiday. Since I have been back I have talked with Mark Campbell and we wondered if the incedo NZ mission community could we somehow make this happen. There total flight costs are $2760 (NZ) They have enough left to cover one Airflight. We are trying to raise the remaining $2000 to cover flight costs and about $500 as a gift to go towards holiday experiences.</p>
  <p>There is absolutely no pressure to help. All we ask is that you ask around fellow volunteers or amongst your office to see if there is any way that you can help bless this fellow YFC family serving in Fiji. As many of you know Sereki does an amazing job with his young people and team. Sereki has been director if Fiji YFC for the past 10 years.</p>
