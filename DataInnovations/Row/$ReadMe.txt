Rowing Prognostics

Originally wrote database to have a table for "Competitor" affiliated to a club; "Competitor_Club", entered in "Crew" / "CrewMember" for events etc.  

Winter Series doesn't need to link to "Competitor" / "Competitor_Club", just enter name.

There is a flag against the "Regatta" table for a single event regatta.  This would work well for Winter Series.

Add a flag in "Regatta" to make use Name rather than using links.  DONE

Working on Entry4.aspx
Use Entry.aspx in the dialog box.
Need to carry over the prognostic details to Entry4.ASPX so can load into the dialog box.


Have added column "Access" to "Competitor" and "Competitor_Club" so that people can signon to load entries for their club or for all
